## Core Dynamics

The system evolves through coordinated services and network consensus:

Action Events (Implemented)

```swift
enum ActionEvent: Event {
    case started(input: String)
    case processed(response: String)
    case completed(confidence: Float)
}

// Event tracking
struct ActionEventLog {
    let events: [ActionEvent]
    let stateHash: Data  // For chain verification
}
```

Experience Events (Implemented)

```swift
enum ExperienceEvent: Event {
    case searchStarted(query: String)
    case priorsFound(count: Int, relevance: Float)
    case synthesisCompleted(Effect)
}
```

## Pattern Formation

Patterns emerge through network consensus:

Pattern Field (Conceptual Model)

```
∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P,E)

where:
- P: pattern strength field
- E: event field
- D: diffusion coefficient
- f: nonlinear coupling
```

This model helps us think about how patterns form and strengthen across the network.
Could inspire future analytics for measuring pattern strength and evolution.

Event Coupling (Conceptual Model)

```
E(x,t) = ∑ᵢ Aᵢexp(ikᵢx - iωᵢt)

where:
- Aᵢ: event amplitudes
- kᵢ: pattern wavenumbers
- ωᵢ: event frequencies
```

A perspective on how events interact and combine across the network.
May guide future implementations of event processing algorithms.

## Implemented Dynamics

Thread stake pricing (Implemented):

```
E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2)

where:
- n: quantum number (stake level)
- ω: thread frequency (organization level)
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

New Message Rewards (Implemented):

```
R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT)

where:
- R_total: Total reward allocation (2.5B)
- k: Decay constant (~2.04)
- t: Current time
- T: Total period (4 years)
```

Prior Value (Implemented):

```
V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i)

where:
- B_t: Treasury balance
- Q(p): Prior quality score
- ∑Q(i): Sum of all quality scores
```

## Event Processing

Network event coordination:

```swift
// Event processor
actor EventProcessor {
    private let network: NetworkState
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let services: [NetworkService]

    func process(_ event: SystemEvent) async throws {
        // Process through network
        try await processDistributed(event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Get network consensus
        try await network.proposeEvent(event)

        // Update patterns
        try await updateNetworkPatterns(event)
    }
}
```

Pattern Recognition

```swift
// Pattern detector
actor PatternDetector {
    private var patterns: [Pattern]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let network: NetworkSyncService

    func detectPatterns() async throws -> [Pattern] {
        // Analyze network events
        let events = eventLog.events

        // Find resonant patterns
        return try await findNetworkPatterns(in: events)
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage

```swift
// Network event storage
@Model
class EventStore {
    let events: [Event]
    let patterns: [Pattern]
    let timestamp: Date
    let networkState: NetworkState

    // Network synchronization
    func sync() async throws {
        try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
            group.addTask { try await self.syncEvents() }
            group.addTask { try await self.syncPatterns() }
            try await group.waitForAll()
        }
    }
}
```

2. Pattern Evolution

```swift
// Pattern tracking
actor PatternManager {
    private var activePatterns: [Pattern]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let network: NetworkSyncService

    func evolvePatterns(_ event: Event) async throws {
        // Update patterns
        try await updatePatterns(event)

        // Get network consensus
        try await network.proposePatterns(activePatterns)

        // Record evolution
        try await eventLog.append(.patternEvolved(activePatterns))
    }
}
```

This dynamics model ensures:

1. Event coherence
2. Network consensus
3. Service coordination
4. Pattern recognition
5. System evolution

The system maintains:

- Event integrity
- Pattern emergence
- State consistency
- Knowledge growth
- Value flow
