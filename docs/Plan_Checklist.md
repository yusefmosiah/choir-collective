## Development Approach

- Documentation-Driven Development

  - Use comprehensive docs to guide implementation
  - Generate tests from documentation
  - AI-assisted code generation
  - Maintain high doc-to-code ratio

- Test-First Development
  - Fuzzing-driven program development
  - Property-based testing
  - Invariant verification
  - Security-first approach

## Notes

- Focus on building secure foundation first
- Prioritize Solana program correctness
- Consider privacy in all integrations
- Plan for AI tooling evolution
