## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1: Core Cycle**
   - Complete step functions
   - Clean up effect types
   - Implement semantic links

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Sync**
   - Thread save/load
   - AI response display
   - Step visualization

3. **Phase 3: Testing**
   - Core cycle tests
   - Frontend integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

## Notes
- Focus on completing core cycle first
- Keep effect system simple but robust
- Implement semantic links as foundation
- Test each component thoroughly

## Success Metrics
- All step functions working
- Effects flowing correctly
- Semantic links recording
- Frontend displaying properly
- Tests passing
