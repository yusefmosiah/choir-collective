## Core Concept

Priors are more than just citations or references - they are quantum semantic states that shape future meaning. When a message references a prior, it creates a resonant coupling between semantic states, strengthening both the original context and its new application.

## Quantum Properties

```typescript
TYPE Prior = {
  // Quantum State
  state: {
    source_message: Hash,        // Original wave function
    source_thread: ThreadId,     // Original resonant cavity
    embedding: Vector,           // Semantic position
    context: string,            // Usage context
  },

  // Coupling Properties
  coupling: {
    resonance: number,         // Harmonic strength
    phase: number,            // Semantic alignment
    entanglement: number,     // Context binding
    coherence: number         // Meaning stability
  },

  // Value Properties
  energy: {
    base_value: TokenAmount,   // Original energy
    coupled_value: TokenAmount, // Resonant enhancement
    treasury_flow: TokenAmount  // Perpetual rewards
  }
}
```

## Resonant Effects

1. **Thread Coupling**
   - Priors create quantum tunnels between threads
   - Energy flows through semantic connections
   - Meaning resonates across contexts
   - Value accumulates through coupling

2. **Phase Locking**
   - Related meanings align phases
   - Coherent understanding emerges
   - Semantic stability increases
   - Knowledge crystallizes naturally

3. **Value Amplification**
   - Resonant coupling increases energy
   - Treasury rewards strengthen bonds
   - Networks of meaning form
   - Collective value grows

## Implementation Patterns

```typescript
TYPE PriorImplementation = {
  // UI Rendering
  display: {
    inline: "Quantum state preview",
    expanded: "Full resonant cavity",
    network: "Coupling visualization"
  },

  // State Management
  state: {
    coupling: "Phase-locked tracking",
    energy: "Value flow monitoring",
    coherence: "Stability measurement"
  },

  // Interaction Handlers
  interactions: {
    preview: "State observation",
    expand: "Full cavity inspection",
    navigate: "Quantum tunneling"
  }
}
```

## Value Mechanics

1. **Energy Flow**
   ```typescript
   TYPE PriorEnergy = {
     initial: "Base semantic value",
     resonant: "Coupling enhancement",
     perpetual: "Treasury rewards",
     collective: "Network effects"
   }
   ```

2. **Treasury Coupling**
   ```typescript
   TYPE TreasuryFlow = {
     source: "Split decision energy",
     distribution: "Prior rewards",
     sustainability: "Perpetual flow",
     enhancement: "Value amplification"
   }
   ```

## Network Effects

1. **Semantic Networks**
   - Priors create meaning graphs
   - Understanding flows through connections
   - Knowledge self-organizes
   - Wisdom emerges naturally

2. **Value Networks**
   - Energy flows through priors
   - Coupled threads share value
   - Networks strengthen naturally
   - Collective worth grows

## UI Treatment

```typescript
TYPE PriorDisplay = {
  // Inline Preview
  preview: {
    marker: "text-blue-500 hover:underline",
    tooltip: "Quantum state preview",
    animation: "Phase transition effects"
  },

  // Full View
  expanded: {
    container: "Resonant cavity display",
    header: "Quantum numbers",
    content: "Wave function details",
    footer: "Coupling metrics"
  },

  // Network View
  network: {
    nodes: "Thread cavities",
    edges: "Quantum tunnels",
    flow: "Energy transfer",
    field: "Semantic field"
  }
}
```

## Evolution Patterns

1. **Natural Selection**
   - Strong priors gain energy
   - Weak couplings fade
   - Quality emerges naturally
   - Understanding crystallizes

2. **Phase Transitions**
   - Knowledge states evolve
   - Understanding deepens
   - Meaning stabilizes
   - Wisdom accumulates

Through this quantum semantic foundation, priors create:
- Natural knowledge organization
- Sustainable value flow
- Emergent understanding
- Collective wisdom

The prior system enables Choir to be more than a chat platform - it becomes a space where meaning and value naturally evolve through quantum semantic principles.
