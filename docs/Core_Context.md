## Overview

Choir is a chat platform where users own their messages and express collective judgment through a token-driven approval system. The platform operates as choir.chat, enabling collaborative discussions where quality and value emerge naturally through user interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Message Ownership & Expression
- Users own their messages
- Public visibility requires collective judgment
- Co-authors shape thread quality through taste
- System empowers quality discernment

### 2. Token System
- CHOIR token (10 billion fixed supply)
- Used for staking and rewards
- Threads hold tokens in Solana accounts
- Treasury enables perpetual citation rewards

### 3. State Architecture
- Solana: Ownership and token custody
- Qdrant: Content and embeddings
- Backend: Real-time coordination
- Frontend: User interaction

### 4. Development Approach
- Documentation-driven development
- Test-first implementation
- AI-assisted code generation
- Pattern recognition and emergence

## Current Status (Oct 26)

### Implementation Progress
- Documentation corpus (~100k tokens)
- create-solana-dapp template deployed
- Initial Render deployment
- Studying Trident fuzzing

### Immediate Timeline
- Oct 27: Environment setup
- Oct 28-29: Token and Solana program
- Oct 30: Backend development
- Oct 31: Frontend and soft launch
- Nov 1-2: Integration and optimization

## Discovered Patterns

Through implementation and observation, several fascinating patterns have emerged:
- Natural temperature dynamics in threads
- Frequency evolution through interaction
- Energy conservation in token flows
- Quality gradients through stake mechanics

These patterns weren't designed in - they emerged through development and provide valuable insights into system behavior.

## Development Strategy

### 1. Documentation-Driven
- Comprehensive specifications
- Test generation from docs
- AI-assisted implementation
- High doc-to-code ratio

### 2. Test-First
- Fuzzing-driven program design
- Property-based testing
- Invariant verification
- Security-first approach

### 3. AI-Assisted
- Code generation from docs
- Test case generation
- Pattern recognition
- Implementation assistance

## Future Evolution

The system will evolve through:
- Enhanced AI capabilities
- Advanced testing tools
- Pattern discovery
- Natural selection of features

Through this approach, we create a foundation for:
- Quality content emergence
- Value conservation
- Pattern recognition
- Sustainable growth

The goal is to enable natural evolution while maintaining system integrity and discovering new patterns of interaction and value creation.
