## Core Architecture

The system operates as a distributed intelligence network:

Network Foundation

- Distributed service coordination
- Network state consensus
- Cross-service communication
- Collective intelligence
- System-wide learning

Service Isolation

- AI service orchestration
- Vector database clustering
- Blockchain consensus
- Network synchronization
- Pattern emergence

Chain Authority

- Solana consensus for:
  - Thread ownership
  - Token balances
  - Message hashes
  - Co-author lists

Network Intelligence

- Vector database for:
  - Message content
  - Embeddings
  - Citations
  - Semantic links

## Event Flow

Events coordinate distributed system state:

Service Events

- AI model coordination
- Vector store synchronization
- Chain consensus
- Network health
- System metrics

Economic Events

- Stake consensus
- Temperature propagation
- Equity distribution
- Reward calculation
- Value flow

Knowledge Events

- Content distribution
- Citation network
- Link strengthening
- Pattern emergence
- Network growth

## System Boundaries

Clear service domain separation:

State Authority

- Chain consensus for ownership
- Vector consensus for content
- Event synchronization
- Network coordination
- Pattern distribution

Resource Boundaries

- Service isolation
- Network coordination
- State consensus
- Resource management
- Pattern emergence

Security Boundaries

- Network verification
- Event integrity
- Service isolation
- Pattern validation
- Consensus flow

## Network Patterns

System patterns emerge through:

Event Flow

- State changes propagate
- Services coordinate
- Patterns emerge
- Recovery enabled
- Evolution guided

Service Organization

- Natural domain separation
- Clean service isolation
- Event-based communication
- Resource management
- Pattern-based structure

Value Distribution

- Chain-based consensus
- Event-driven rewards
- Pattern-based value
- Network flow
- Emergent worth

## Implementation Foundation

Built on distributed foundations:

Swift Concurrency

- Actor-based services
- Structured concurrency
- Async/await flow
- Resource safety
- Pattern support

Network First

- Service coordination
- Content distribution
- Event synchronization
- Pattern recognition
- System evolution

Event Driven

- Network state flow
- Service coordination
- Pattern emergence
- Value distribution
- System evolution

This architecture enables:

1. Network consensus
2. Service coordination
3. Clean isolation
4. Pattern emergence
5. System evolution

The system ensures:

- State coherence
- Event integrity
- Resource safety
- Pattern recognition
- Network growth
