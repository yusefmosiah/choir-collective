## Core Architecture

The system operates through natural event flows and clear authority boundaries:

Event Foundation
- Events capture all system changes
- State transitions flow as events
- Components communicate via events
- Security verifies through events
- Recovery enabled by event history

Actor Isolation
- Each domain lives in its own actor
- Actors communicate through events
- State remains properly isolated
- Resources cleanly managed
- Patterns emerge naturally

Chain Authority
- Solana state authoritative for:
  - Thread ownership
  - Token balances
  - Message hashes
  - Co-author lists

Local Authority
- LanceDB authoritative for:
  - Message content
  - Embeddings
  - Citations
  - Semantic links

## Event Flow

Events flow naturally through system boundaries:

State Events
- Chain state changes
- Content updates
- Local coordination
- UI updates
- System health

Economic Events
- Stake deposits
- Temperature changes
- Equity distribution
- Reward issuance
- Value flow

Knowledge Events
- Content storage
- Citation recording
- Link strengthening
- Pattern emergence
- Network growth

## System Boundaries

Clear domain separation through:

State Authority
- Chain state for ownership/tokens
- Vector state for content/embeddings
- Local state for coordination
- Event state for flow
- Pattern state for emergence

Resource Boundaries
- Actor isolation for safety
- Event flow for coordination
- State isolation for clarity
- Resource management for efficiency
- Pattern emergence for evolution

Security Boundaries
- Chain verification
- Event integrity
- Actor isolation
- Pattern validation
- Natural flow

## Natural Patterns

System patterns emerge through:

Event Flow
- State changes flow naturally
- Components coordinate through events
- Patterns emerge from flow
- Recovery enabled by history
- Evolution guided by events

Actor Organization
- Natural domain separation
- Clean state isolation
- Event-based communication
- Resource containment
- Pattern-based structure

Value Distribution
- Chain-based ownership
- Event-driven rewards
- Pattern-based value
- Natural flow
- Emergent worth

## Implementation Foundation

Built on natural foundations:

Swift Concurrency
- Actor-based isolation
- Structured concurrency
- Async/await flow
- Resource safety
- Pattern support

Local First
- Chain authority respected
- Content locally verified
- Events locally tracked
- Patterns locally recognized
- Evolution locally enabled

Event Driven
- Natural state flow
- Clean coordination
- Pattern emergence
- Value distribution
- System evolution

This architecture enables:
1. Clear authority boundaries
2. Natural event flow
3. Clean actor isolation
4. Pattern emergence
5. System evolution

The system ensures:
- State integrity
- Event coherence
- Resource safety
- Pattern recognition
- Natural growth
