## Core Wave Mechanics

The system operates as a quantum field where events create waves of state change. At its foundation is the quantum harmonic oscillator:

Energy Levels (Physics)

```
E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2)

where:
- E(n): energy of quantum level n
- n: quantum number
- ω: natural frequency
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

This fundamental formula from quantum mechanics describes the discrete energy levels of a harmonic oscillator. In our system, we implement it directly for thread stake pricing:

Thread Stake Pricing (Implemented)

```
E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2)

where:
- n: quantum number (stake level)
- ω: thread frequency (organization level)
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

Wave Function (Conceptual Model)

```
Ψ(x,t) = A cos(kx - ωt + φ)

where:
- A: amplitude (value/meaning strength)
- k: wavenumber (spatial frequency)
- ω: angular frequency (temporal evolution)
- φ: phase (context alignment)
```

This model helps us think about how information and value propagate through the system.

Event Field (Conceptual Model)

```
E(s,t) = ∑ᵢ eᵢ(s,t)

where:
- s: system state vector
- t: event timestamp
- eᵢ: individual event waves
```

A perspective on how events combine and interact across the network.

## Reward Mechanics

The system implements specific formulas for reward distribution:

New Message Rewards (Implemented)

```
R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT)

where:
- R_total: Total allocation (2.5B)
- k: Decay constant (~2.04)
- t: Current time
- T: Total period (4 years)
```

Prior Value (Implemented)

```
V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i)

where:
- B_t: Treasury balance
- Q(p): Prior quality score
- ∑Q(i): Sum of all quality scores
```

## State Evolution

State evolution follows quantum principles:

State Transition (Conceptual Model)

```
|Ψ(t)⟩ = ∑ᵢ αᵢ|eᵢ⟩

where:
- |Ψ(t)⟩: system state
- αᵢ: event amplitudes
- |eᵢ⟩: event basis states
```

This model helps us understand how the system evolves through event sequences.

## Plain English Understanding

Think of the system like a musical instrument:

1. Events as Vibrations

- Each event creates ripples in the system
- Events combine like harmonics
- Patterns emerge from resonance
- Value flows through standing waves

2. Natural Frequencies

- Threads have natural frequencies (implemented in stake pricing)
- Teams synchronize phases
- Quality emerges from harmony
- Value crystallizes at nodes

3. Event Flow

- Events create state changes
- Network coordinates consensus
- Patterns emerge naturally
- System evolves harmonically

## Mathematical Properties

These conceptual models help us think about system behavior:

1. Energy Conservation

```
∂E/∂t + ∇·j = 0

where:
- E: system energy
- j: energy current density
```

Guides our thinking about value conservation in the network.

2. Phase Coherence

```
⟨Ψ₁|Ψ₂⟩ = ∫ Ψ₁*(x)Ψ₂(x)dx
```

A model for thinking about team alignment and consensus.

3. Pattern Evolution

```
∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P)

where:
- P: pattern field
- D: diffusion coefficient
- f(P): nonlinear reaction term
```

Helps us understand how patterns strengthen across the network.

This foundation provides:

1. Precise economic calculations (implemented formulas)
2. Rich conceptual models
3. Network understanding
4. Pattern insights
5. Evolution framework

The system builds on:

- Quantum mechanics for pricing
- Wave mechanics for events
- Field theory for patterns
- Network dynamics for evolution

The genius lies in combining precise implementations with powerful conceptual models, creating a system that's both practically effective and theoretically elegant.
