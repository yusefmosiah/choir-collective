## Core Wave Mechanics

The system operates as a harmonic field where events create waves of state change:

Wave Function
```
Ψ(x,t) = A cos(kx - ωt + φ)

where:
- A: amplitude (value/meaning strength)
- k: wavenumber (spatial frequency)
- ω: angular frequency (temporal evolution)
- φ: phase (context alignment)
```

Event Field
```
E(s,t) = ∑ᵢ eᵢ(s,t)

where:
- s: system state vector
- t: event timestamp
- eᵢ: individual event waves
```

## Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

Thread energy states follow the quantum harmonic oscillator:

Base Price Function
```
P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: base stake quantum
- ω: thread frequency
- T: thread temperature
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

Energy Levels
```
E(n) = ℏω(n + 1/2)

where:
- n: quantum number
- ω: natural frequency
```

## Event-Driven Evolution

State evolution through event waves:

State Transition
```
|Ψ(t)⟩ = ∑ᵢ αᵢ|eᵢ⟩

where:
- |Ψ(t)⟩: system state
- αᵢ: event amplitudes
- |eᵢ⟩: event basis states
```

Local Event Log
```swift
struct EventLog {
    let events: [Event]        // Ordered event sequence
    let state: SystemState     // Current state vector
    let timestamp: Date        // Last update time
}
```

## Plain English Understanding

Think of the system like a musical instrument:

1. Events as Vibrations
- Each event creates ripples in the system
- Events combine like harmonics
- Patterns emerge from resonance
- Value flows through standing waves

2. Natural Frequencies
- Threads have natural frequencies
- Teams synchronize phases
- Quality emerges from harmony
- Value crystallizes at nodes

3. Event Flow
- Local events create waves
- Chain anchors key states
- Patterns emerge naturally
- System evolves harmonically

## Mathematical Properties

1. Energy Conservation
```
∂E/∂t + ∇·j = 0

where:
- E: system energy
- j: energy current density
```

2. Phase Coherence
```
⟨Ψ₁|Ψ₂⟩ = ∫ Ψ₁*(x)Ψ₂(x)dx
```

3. Pattern Evolution
```
∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P)

where:
- P: pattern field
- D: diffusion coefficient
- f(P): nonlinear reaction term
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage
```swift
// Local event log in SwiftData
@Model
class LocalEventLog {
    let events: [Event]
    let stateHash: Data
    let timestamp: Date

    // Sync with service layer
    func sync() async throws {
        try await service.uploadEvents(events)
    }
}
```

2. State Evolution
```swift
// Event-driven state updates
actor StateManager {
    private var currentState: SystemState
    private let eventLog: LocalEventLog

    func apply(_ event: Event) async throws {
        // Update state
        currentState = try await evolve(currentState, with: event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Sync if needed
        if shouldSync {
            try await eventLog.sync()
        }
    }
}
```

This foundation provides:
1. Mathematical precision
2. Event-driven evolution
3. Local-first operation
4. Natural harmonics
5. Pattern emergence

The system ensures:
- Wave coherence
- Event integrity
- State evolution
- Pattern formation
- Value flow
