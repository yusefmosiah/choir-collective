## Core Ownership Concepts

1. **Equity Distribution**

```typescript
type ThreadEquity = {
  equity_map: Map<PublicKey, float>; // co-author -> ownership share
  total_value: number; // accumulated stake value
  temperature: number; // T from denials
  frequency: number; // ω from activity
};
```

2. **Stake-to-Equity Conversion**

```python
def calculate_equity(stake: float, base_price: float, coauthor_count: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate equity share from stake amount using quantum harmonic oscillator.

    stake: Amount being staked
    base_price: P₀ from harmonic oscillator equation
    coauthor_count: Current number of co-authors (N)
    """
    # Quantum number from stake ratio
    n = stake / base_price

    # Equity follows √n scaling
    quantum_share = 1.0 / coauthor_count
    equity_share = quantum_share * math.sqrt(n)

    return equity_share
```

## Thread Thermodynamics

1. **State Properties**

```typescript
type ThreadState = {
  energy: number; // E (total thread energy from denials)
  temperature: number; // T = E/N (energy per co-author)
  frequency: number; // ω (evolution rate)
  co_authors: Map<
    PublicKey,
    {
      equity_share: float; // Ownership percentage
      join_time: DateTime; // For cooling calculations
    }
  >;
  cooling_factor: number; // κ (age-based cooling)
};
```

2. **Energy Flow**

```typescript
type EnergyFlow = {
  rejection: {
    effect: "Increases thread energy";
    temperature: "Rises (E/N increases)";
    frequency: "Unchanged";
  };
  approval: {
    effect: "Distributes to co-authors by equity";
    temperature: "Unchanged";
    frequency: "Increases";
  };
};
```

## Ownership Evolution

1. **New Co-author Addition**

```python
async def add_coauthor(thread: Thread, stake: float):
    # Calculate base price from harmonic oscillator
    base_price = calculate_base_price(
        thread.temperature,
        thread.frequency
    )

    # Calculate equity share
    equity = calculate_equity(
        stake=stake,
        base_price=base_price,
        coauthor_count=len(thread.co_authors)
    )

    # Update equity map
    thread.equity_map[new_author] = equity
```

2. **Reward Distribution**

```python
async def distribute_rewards(thread: Thread, stake: float):
    """Distribute approval rewards based on equity shares."""
    for coauthor, equity in thread.equity_map.items():
        reward = stake * equity
        await send_tokens(coauthor, reward)
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Equity Scaling Properties**

- No minimum stake requirement
- Continuous stake-to-equity curve
- Natural √n scaling from physics
- Proportional reward distribution

2. **Temperature Effects**

- Denials increase thread temperature
- Higher temperature raises base price
- Creates natural quality barrier
- Maintains thread coherence

3. **Frequency Evolution**

- Activity increases frequency
- Higher frequency affects base price
- Natural resonance patterns
- Phase-locked stability

## Future Considerations

1. **Advanced Equity Models**

- Multi-thread equity coupling
- Complex ownership networks
- Quantum entanglement effects
- Dynamic equity evolution

2. **Ecosystem Development**

- Thread equity networks
- Value flow optimization
- Natural niche formation
- Self-organizing standards

Through this model, ownership becomes a quantum property emerging from stake contributions and thread thermodynamics, creating a natural and fair system for value distribution.
