docs_version: "0.2.0"

## Core Ownership Concepts

ASSUMPTION ownership_model:
"Temperature-based access control"
"Energy-driven participation"
"Must maintain thermodynamic stability"

## Thread Thermodynamics

1. **State Properties**

   ```typescript
   type ThreadState = {
     energy: number; // E (total thread energy)
     temperature: number; // T = E/N (energy per co-author)
     frequency: number; // ω (evolution rate)
     co_authors: PublicKey[]; // N (system size)
     cooling_factor: number; // κ (age-based cooling)
   };
   ```

2. **Energy Distribution**
   ```typescript
   type EnergyFlow = {
     rejection: {
       effect: "Increases thread energy";
       temperature: "Rises (E/N increases)";
       frequency: "Unchanged";
     };
     approval: {
       effect: "Distributes energy to approvers";
       temperature: "Moderates (E/N decreases)";
       frequency: "Increases";
     };
   };
   ```

## Access Control

1. **Temperature-Based Barriers**

   - Hot threads: Higher stake requirements
   - Cool threads: Lower barriers to entry
   - Natural selection through energy requirements
   - Quality emerges from temperature gradients

2. **Frequency-Based Evolution**
   - Higher frequency = faster evolution
   - Co-author coupling strengthens frequency
   - Natural resonance patterns emerge
   - System self-organizes through harmonics

## State Management

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```typescript
   PROPERTY energy_conservation:
     thread.energy = sum(stakes) - sum(distributions)
     INVARIANT: energy >= 0
   ```

2. **Temperature Evolution**

   ```typescript
   FUNCTION evolve_temperature(thread: Thread, time: Duration):
     cooling = 1 + sqrt(time.days * thread.co_authors.length)
     thread.temperature = thread.energy / (thread.co_authors.length * cooling)
   ```

3. **Frequency Management**
   ```typescript
   FUNCTION calculate_frequency(thread: Thread):
     message_mode = thread.message_rate / sqrt(N)
     value_mode = log(1 + thread.energy/N)
     coupling = 1/N
     return sqrt((message_mode² + value_mode²)/2 + coupling*N)
   ```

## Phase Transitions

1. **Thread Evolution**

   - Young threads start hot and volatile
   - Mature threads cool and stabilize
   - Quality barriers emerge naturally
   - Communities crystallize organically

2. **State Changes**
   ```typescript
   TYPE PhaseTransition =
     | Heating   // Rejection increases temperature
     | Cooling   // Natural age-based evolution
     | Coupling  // New co-author changes frequency
     | Resonance // Activity aligns with frequency
   ```

## Implementation Notes

NOTE thermodynamic_implementation:
"Current model uses classical thermodynamics"
"May introduce quantum effects"
"Must preserve energy conservation"

NOTE scaling_considerations:
"Anderson normalization for large N"
"Natural cooling prevents instability"
"Must maintain coherent evolution"

## Future Directions

1. **Advanced Thermodynamics**

   - Multi-thread energy coupling
   - Complex phase transitions
   - Quantum coherence effects
   - Resonance amplification

2. **Ecosystem Evolution**
   - Thread temperature networks
   - Energy flow optimization
   - Natural niche formation
   - Self-organizing quality standards

Through this thermodynamic model, thread ownership becomes an emergent property of natural energy flows and temperature evolution, creating a self-organizing system that maintains quality through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules.
