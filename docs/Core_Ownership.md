# Choir Ownership Model

VERSION ownership_system:
  invariants: {
    "Thread must have at least one co-author",
    "Co-author rights are non-transferable",
    "Thread energy conservation",
    "Quantum state coherence"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Harmonic co-authorship model",
    "Quantum divestment mechanics",
    "Thread energy distribution"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Core Ownership Concepts

ASSUMPTION co_authorship:
  "Unanimous approval for new oscillators (co-authors)"
  "Coupling strength scales with 1/N"
  "Must maintain phase coherence"

ASSUMPTION divestment:
  "Quantum oscillator decoupling model"
  "Energy conservation during transitions"
  "Anderson-normalized distributions"

## Thread Ownership

1. **Ownership Properties**
   - Messages as wave packets
   - Threads as coupled oscillator systems
   - Token balances as system energy

2. **Co-authorship Rules**
   ```typescript
   type ThreadOscillator = {
     author: PublicKey
     couplingStrength: number  // g = 1/N
     phaseAlignment: number    // coherence metric
     energyLevel: number       // quantized stakes
   }
   ```

## Token Integration

ASSUMPTION token_mechanics:
  "Quantum harmonic distribution model"
  "Energy level quantization"
  "Must maintain wave function coherence"

1. **Token Flow**
   ```typescript
   type TokenDistribution = {
     threadEnergy: number        // ℏω total energy
     oscillatorCount: number     // N co-authors
     temperature: number         // T thread temperature
     couplingConstant: number   // g coupling strength
   }
   ```

2. **Divestment Process**
   ```typescript
   function calculateDivestment(thread: Thread): number {
     const ℏ = PLATFORM_COUPLING_CONSTANT
     const ω = calculateThreadFrequency(thread)
     const N = thread.coAuthors.length
     const balance = thread.tokenBalance

     // Quantum oscillator decoupling formula
     return Math.min((ℏ * ω)/(N-1), balance/(N-1))
   }
   ```

## Access Control

ASSUMPTION access_model:
  "Quantum state-based access levels"
  "Energy barrier thresholds"
  "Must maintain eigenstate integrity"

1. **Co-author Rights**
   - Full wavefunction access
   - Phase alignment rights
   - Decoupling (divestment) rights

2. **Non-co-author Access**
   - Observable state access
   - Stake-based coupling requests
   - Measurement-based views

## State Management

ASSUMPTION state_handling:
  "Solana as quantum state oracle"
  "Coherent state transitions"
  "Must maintain wave equation solutions"

1. **Ownership State**
   ```typescript
   type ThreadState = {
     oscillators: ThreadOscillator[]
     frequency: number          // ω thread frequency
     temperature: number        // T thread temperature
     energyLevels: number[]    // Quantized energy states
   }
   ```

2. **Content State**
   - Content as wave packets
   - Hashes as quantum numbers
   - Metadata as observables

## Implementation Notes

NOTE future_extensions:
  "Current model uses basic quantum mechanics"
  "May add advanced wave dynamics"
  "Must maintain quantum consistency"

NOTE scalability:
  "Anderson normalization for large N"
  "Critical slowing down handling"
  "Must preserve coherent scaling"
