## Mission

To create a communication platform where quality emerges naturally through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules, ultimately developing communities that evolve like natural systems.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Thread Dynamics

- Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors
- Thread temperature (T) measures volatility/activity
- Thread frequency (ω) measures organization/coherence
- Natural cooling over time creates stability

### 2. Token Flow

- **Rejections:** Stake flows to thread, increasing temperature
- **Split Decisions:** Approvers' stake flows to Treasury
- **Approvals:** Stake distributes to approvers
- **Treasury:** Funds perpetual citation rewards

### 3. Reward Structure

- **New Message Rewards:**

  - High initial distribution
  - Logarithmic decay over 4 years
  - 50% distributed in year 1
  - 99% distributed by year 4

- **Citation Rewards:**
  - Funded by Treasury
  - Perpetual availability
  - Encourages content linking
  - Promotes knowledge network growth

## Natural Evolution

### 1. Temperature Dynamics

- Hot threads (high T):

  - Higher stake requirements
  - More volatile state
  - Quality filter through cost
  - Natural selection pressure

- Cool threads (low T):
  - Lower barriers to entry
  - More stable state
  - Experimental space
  - Nurtures new voices

### 2. Frequency Effects

- Higher frequency (ω) = better organization
- Co-authors strengthen coherence
- Natural resonance emerges
- Communities crystallize naturally

### 3. Energy Conservation

- Total token supply fixed at 10 billion
- Circular flow through Treasury
- Split decisions feed citation rewards
- System maintains equilibrium

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Message Submission

- Users stake CHOIR tokens
- Stake requirement based on T and ω
- Energy locked until state transition
- Natural barrier against noise

### 2. Approval Process

- Co-authors evaluate within 7 days
- Unanimous approval required
- Split decisions feed Treasury
- Rejections heat up threads

### 3. Value Distribution

- Approved messages: tokens to approvers
- Rejected messages: tokens to thread
- Split decisions: approvers' tokens to Treasury
- Citations: perpetual rewards from Treasury

## Technical Foundation

### 1. Quantum Harmonic Model

- Threads as oscillator systems
- Energy conservation principles
- Phase transition dynamics
- Natural frequency evolution

### 2. Implementation

- Solana blockchain for token accounting
- Real-time state transitions
- AI-enhanced pattern recognition
- Natural system monitoring

## Future Vision

The platform will evolve like a natural system:

- Communities will find their frequencies
- Quality standards will emerge organically
- Value will flow to coherent patterns
- Evolution will be sustainable

## Join Us

Experience a platform where quality emerges naturally, communities evolve organically, and value aligns with coherence. Be part of a system that works with nature rather than against it.
