## Mission

To create a communication platform where quality emerges naturally through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules, ultimately developing communities that evolve like natural systems.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Thread Dynamics

- Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors
- Threads act as resonant cavities for value
- Teams naturally form around valuable threads
- Natural cooling over time creates stability

### 2. Token Flow

- **Unanimous Approval**: Stake distributes equally to approvers as direct reward
- **Denials**: Stake flows to thread, strengthening the collective
- **Split Decisions**:
  - Approvers' share flows to Treasury
  - Deniers' share strengthens thread
- **Prior Rewards**: Treasury funds thread citations, coupling knowledge networks

### 3. Team Formation

- Threads accumulate collective value
- Co-authors share thread success
- Quality benefits whole team
- Natural incentive alignment

### 4. Knowledge Networks

- Threads cite valuable threads
- Prior rewards strengthen thread coupling
- Knowledge topology emerges
- System-wide coherence develops

## Natural Evolution

### 1. Temperature Dynamics

- Hot threads (high activity):

  - Higher stake requirements
  - More volatile state
  - Quality filter through cost
  - Natural selection pressure

- Cool threads (stable):
  - Lower barriers to entry
  - More stable state
  - Experimental space
  - Nurtures new voices

### 2. Frequency Effects

- Higher frequency = better organization
- Co-authors strengthen coherence
- Natural resonance emerges
- Communities crystallize naturally

### 3. Energy Conservation

- Total token supply fixed at 10 billion
- Circular flow through Treasury
- Split decisions feed prior rewards
- System maintains equilibrium

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Message Submission

- Users stake CHOIR tokens
- Stake requirement based on thread state
- Energy locked until decision
- Natural barrier against noise

### 2. Approval Process

- Co-authors evaluate within 7 days
- Unanimous approval required
- Split decisions balance incentives
- Denials strengthen threads

### 3. Value Distribution

- Approvers receive direct rewards
- Threads accumulate collective value
- Treasury enables knowledge coupling
- Teams share success

## Technical Foundation

### 1. Quantum Harmonic Model

- Threads as resonant cavities
- Energy conservation principles
- Phase transition dynamics
- Natural frequency evolution

### 2. Implementation

- Solana blockchain for token accounting
- Real-time state transitions
- AI-enhanced pattern recognition
- Natural system monitoring

## Future Vision

The platform will evolve like a natural system:

- Teams will form around resonant threads
- Quality standards will emerge organically
- Knowledge networks will self-organize
- Evolution will be sustainable

## Join Us

Experience a platform where quality emerges naturally, teams form organically, and value aligns with coherence. Be part of a system that works with nature rather than against it.
