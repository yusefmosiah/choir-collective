# Frontend Architecture Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the frontend rehydration process, focusing on integrating real-time updates, user interaction, and AI response handling.

## Core Components

1. **Choir Chat Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Facilitate real-time communication and interaction.
   - **Key Features**:
     - WebSocket integration for live updates.
     - State management for threads and messages.
     - Responsive design for various devices.

2. **Chorus Panel**
   - **Purpose**: Provide an interactive UI for managing threads and AI responses.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Tab navigation for different sections.
     - Bottom sheet for mobile-first design.
     - Integration with AI response components.

3. **AI Response Handling**
   - **Purpose**: Enhance user interaction with AI-generated content.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Display AI responses in a user-friendly manner.
     - Manage AI response state and interactivity.
     - Integrate with the Chorus Cycle for seamless updates.

4. **User Input Management**
   - **Purpose**: Capture and process user input efficiently.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Input validation and feedback mechanisms.
     - Integration with backend for processing.
     - Real-time updates and error handling.

## State Management

- **Global State**: Managed using a state management library (e.g., Redux, Context API).
- **Local State**: Managed within components for UI-specific interactions.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implemented for real-time feedback before server confirmation.

## Integration Points

- **WebSocket Protocol**: Ensure seamless integration for real-time updates.
- **Backend API**: Connect with backend endpoints for data retrieval and submission.
- **AI Services**: Integrate AI response handling for enhanced user interaction.

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for components and data.
- **Code Splitting**: Use code splitting to optimize bundle size.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

## Security and Privacy

- **Authentication**: Ensure secure user authentication and session management.
- **Data Privacy**: Implement privacy controls for user data and interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for security incidents.
