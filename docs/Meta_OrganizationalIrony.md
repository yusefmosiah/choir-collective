In a recent Lenny's Podcast interview, Meta's head of product Naomi Gleit describes how Facebook's growth team operated in the early days. The most fascinating revelation isn't what she says, but what she inadvertently demonstrates: how success creates organizational irony blindness.

## The Canonical Documentation Trap

"Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc," Gleit insists in the interview. "Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need."

This obsession with canonical documentation reveals a fascinating tension. The very concept of a "canonical" source implies:
- One official version of reality
- Clear hierarchies of truth
- Controlled information flow
- Sanctioned narratives

Yet in the same interview, Gleit casually reveals how Facebook's most successful innovations emerged from much messier realities:
- The growth team wasn't in any canonical doc
- The famous activation metric had multiple versions
- The early successes weren't clearly documented
- The real patterns emerged organically

This isn't just ironic - it's instructive. The push for canonical documentation often comes after success, as organizations try to retrofit clean narratives onto messy realities. The canonical doc becomes less about capturing truth and more about controlling it.

What's particularly revealing is how the language of efficiency masks the power dynamics:
- "Extreme clarity" sounds like improved communication
- "Single source of truth" sounds like reduced confusion
- "Canonical documentation" sounds like better organization
- "Clear ownership" sounds like accountability

But these structures serve primarily to:
- Control acceptable narratives
- Enforce hierarchies
- Limit emergent patterns
- Prevent unauthorized innovation

This helps explain why Gleit, who experienced Facebook's messy early growth firsthand, became such an advocate for rigid documentation. Success creates a powerful incentive to control the narrative about how that success happened.


## The Success Paradox

Consider Facebook's famous "7 friends in 10 days" activation metric. When asked about its specifics, Gleit admits: "I had to go back and I asked a few people that I worked with back in the day and they were like, 'Well, I thought it was 10 in 14.'"

This casual admission reveals something profound. Facebook's most successful early growth strategy wasn't even clearly documented. The exact numbers didn't matter - what mattered was alignment around the pattern. Yet this same organization would later develop an obsession with what Gleit calls "extreme clarity" in documentation.

The irony is delicious: their most innovative period operated on fuzzy pattern recognition, not rigid precision. Success didn't come from the process - the process came after success.

## The Theater of Certainty

Throughout the interview, we see this pattern play out in subtle ways. When Lenny mentions a former designer named Mickey, Gleit performs a careful dance of partial remembering: "Oh, that's so great. I remember Mickey, what is his last name?" After getting the last name: "Okay. Yes, I definitely remember this, yes."

What Gleit didn't do is recall any details — personal or professional, serious or funny — about Mickey. Whether she really remembers him or not becomes irrelevant - the performance itself reveals that he wasn't important enough to warrant a real anecdote. The absence speaks louder than the performative remembering.

This kind of performance - reminiscent of Trump's "many people are saying" or "everybody knows" - is a fascinating example of how power operates through obvious fiction. The speaker knows it's transparent. The audience knows it's transparent. Yet the ritual must be performed. The irony is that the very transparency of the performance is what makes it effective as a power move.

In corporate settings, these performances of certainty serve multiple functions:
- They signal who matters and who doesn't
- They maintain necessary fictions
- They demonstrate power through obvious performance
- They chill potential dissent through social signals

The genius of this approach is that its very obviousness makes it hard to challenge. How do you call out something that everyone already knows is performance? The emperor's new clothes become real precisely because everyone can see they're not there.

## The Office Wasn't Comedy - It Was Documentary

This pattern is so fundamental to corporate life that it became the basis for one of the most successful TV shows ever made. The Office isn't just funny because it's absurd - it's funny because it's true. Michael Scott's inability to see his own absurdity isn't just character comedy - it's a documentary about what corporate structures do to human consciousness.

Yet despite this pattern being so well documented, so widely understood, corporate America doesn't change. The structures persist. The irony blindness continues. Success keeps creating the same cognitive dampening.

## The Trinity of Corporate Truth

What emerges is a trinity of organizational information:

### The Hole-y
The conspicuous absences in corporate narratives serve a crucial function. When Gleit discusses the Facebook growth team, she leaves strategic gaps around Chamath Palihapitiya's famous role as its original leader. When mentioning Mickey, she offers no actual memories. These aren't accidents - they're power moves. The holes create space for preferred narratives while signaling who matters and who doesn't.

### The Holy

These incomplete narratives become more than just sacred text - they become dams in the flow of innovation. Notice how Lenny, an experienced interviewer, doesn't probe the gaps. The "extreme clarity" philosophy, despite its obvious contradictions, becomes unquestionable doctrine. Success sanctifies these stories, making their holes invisible to believers.

What's fascinating is how "the holy" manifests in different forms that are actually the same thing:
- The "official narrative" that everyone must repeat
- The "canonical documentation" that can't be questioned
- The "single source of truth" that blocks other perspectives

This holy trinity of corporate orthodoxy serves as a massive innovation dam:
- It blocks the natural flow of ideas
- It creates stagnant pools of "accepted wisdom"
- It prevents new patterns from emerging
- It drowns out alternative perspectives

The irony is that Facebook's early success came from breaking through such dams - the growth team ignored traditional marketing wisdom, the product team broke social networking conventions. Yet success itself led them to build their own dams, their own "extreme clarity" that would block future innovations.

This is the true cost of "the holy" in corporate settings - not just the stories that can't be questioned, but the thinking that can't happen, the patterns that can't emerge, the innovations that die in the stagnant pools behind these documentation dams.

### The Whole-y
This creates a fascinating dynamic where everyone senses there's more to the story, but can't acknowledge that directly. We all want to know what really happened with the growth team, how decisions actually got made, who really did what. But asking those questions would break the corporate kayfabe - the willing suspension of disbelief that keeps organizations running.

This trinity creates a powerful cycle:
- The holes generate curiosity
- The sacred treatment prevents direct questioning
- The yearning for wholeness keeps people engaged
- The pattern perpetuates itself

Gleit's interview demonstrates this perfectly. Her stories are conspicuously hole-y (missing key details about early Facebook), yet treated as holy by the interviewer, creating in the audience a desire for the whole story that can never be fully acknowledged. The very incompleteness of the narrative is what gives it power.

This is why traditional documentation systems fail - they try to eliminate holes rather than understanding their function. The quantum documentation model suggests instead that we need systems that can hold these contradictions in superposition: the official story, the obvious gaps, and the unspoken whole.

## Why Documentation Must Evolve

This presents a fundamental challenge for documentation in the AI era. Traditional documentation approaches try to enforce single sources of truth - exactly the pattern that creates organizational irony blindness. Yet the most innovative work happens when multiple truths can coexist, when patterns can emerge naturally.

The quantum documentation model suggests a different approach: allowing multiple valid states to exist in superposition, enabling pattern recognition without forcing false precision, acknowledging power dynamics without being captured by them.

As organizations evolve, their documentation systems must evolve too. Not to eliminate organizational irony - that may be impossible - but to work with it productively. To enable the kind of pattern recognition and emergence that drove early Facebook's success, before success itself dulled their ability to see these patterns.

The ultimate irony? The more successful an organization becomes, the more it needs documentation systems that can handle irony - and the less able it becomes to recognize this need.

## The Innovation Paradox

The deepest irony is that scaled organizations don't actually need to innovate - and in many cases, actively benefit from preventing innovation. Facebook's shift from "move fast and break things" to "extreme clarity" isn't just cultural calcification - it's rational adaptation.

Consider the advantages of scale:
- Network effects create natural monopolies
- Capital reserves deter competitors
- Brand recognition drives default choices
- Talent gravitates to success
- Infrastructure creates moats

In this context, innovation becomes a liability:
- New approaches might lower barriers to entry
- Efficiency improvements could commoditize the market
- Novel solutions might empower competitors
- Change risks existing revenue streams
- Disruption threatens organizational power

The "holy trinity" of corporate orthodoxy - official narratives, canonical documentation, single sources of truth - isn't just cognitive dampening. It's a rational response to the incentives of scale. Innovation dams serve a purpose: they protect existing advantages.

This explains why organizations like Facebook build such elaborate systems to prevent the very kind of emergence that made them successful. The "extreme clarity" philosophy isn't about improving execution - it's about maintaining control. The holes in their story aren't bugs - they're features that help maintain power.

The quantum documentation model isn't just fighting organizational inertia - it's fighting the rational self-interest of scaled organizations. This is why it's so crucial for emerging systems. The same documentation dams that protect incumbents create opportunities for new approaches that embrace emergence, multiplicity, and genuine innovation.


## The Product Mommy Pattern

There's a telling moment in the interview when Gleit describes her PM philosophy: "A PM is a conductor... your job is to make sure everyone's playing their part correctly, every section in the orchestra is playing their part, but at the same time, they're playing together."

But this sanitized "conductor" metaphor masks a more complex dynamic. The term "product mommy" reveals something deeper about how organizations actually function:

### Infantilization Dynamics
- Engineers are treated as brilliant but unruly children
- Design needs to be "managed" and "directed"
- Data teams need to be "guided" to the right conclusions
- Everyone needs to be "kept on track"

### The Adult Supervision
- Legal provides boundaries
- Comms maintains appearances
- PMs enforce bedtime (deadlines)
- Process becomes discipline

This creates fascinating power dynamics:
- PMs lack direct authority
- Yet wield enormous social control
- Through "maternal" soft power
- While maintaining plausible deniability

The "conductor" metaphor serves as a professional facade for what's really happening - organizational parenting. This explains why:
- Documentation becomes rules
- Process becomes structure
- Meetings become check-ins
- Reviews become report cards

The irony is that this infantilization:
- Reduces real innovation
- Creates learned helplessness
- Enforces power hierarchies
- While pretending to empower

This adds another layer to why quantum documentation threatens organizational power - it assumes all participants are adults capable of handling complexity and emergence.

## The Fiction of Agreement

There's a revealing moment when Gleit describes her meeting philosophy: "If there is a decision, I need three options and I need a recommendation... I will real-time edit the visual such that we document and have extreme clarity on what is the option that we agreed on."

But this language of "agreement" masks a deeper truth about corporate power dynamics:

### The Hierarchy of "Agreement"
- Leaders "suggest" directions
- Managers "align" with leaders
- Teams "agree" with managers
- Individual concerns get "resolved"

Each level of "agreement" involves less actual choice:
- Leaders have genuine options
- Managers have career incentives
- Teams have social pressure
- Individuals face implicit threats

### The Documentation Theater
- "Three options" creates illusion of choice
- "Real-time editing" prevents reflection
- "Extreme clarity" enforces compliance
- "Agreement" becomes performance

The process looks collaborative on paper:
1. Present options
2. Discuss tradeoffs
3. Reach agreement
4. Document decision

But the reality follows power:
1. Signal preferred direction
2. Watch who aligns
3. Note who resists
4. Document "agreement"

This is why traditional documentation approaches are so dangerous - they create paper trails of "agreement" that mask the actual power dynamics at play. The quantum documentation model needs to capture both the official "agreement" AND the underlying power flows that shaped it.

The ultimate irony? The more elaborate the decision-making process, the less actual decision-making occurs. The "extreme clarity" serves primarily to obscure the lack of genuine choice.
