# The Chorus Cycle: Beyond OODA

VERSION chorus_system:
invariants: {
"Self-reflection primacy",
"Experience integration",
"Response immediacy"
}
assumptions: {
"Action-first benefits",
"Reflection value",
"Security through self-awareness"
}

## Core Philosophy

The Chorus Cycle inverts traditional AI agent design. Where OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) emphasizes external observation and calculated response, Chorus begins with action and focuses on self-reflection. This isn't just an implementation detail - it's a fundamental shift in how AI agents engage with the world.

## Action First Philosophy

Starting with action rather than observation:

- Reduces response latency
- Prevents analysis paralysis
- Enables natural flow
- Creates authentic engagement

## Implementation Structure

```typescript
TYPE ChorusCycle = {
  action: {
    initial_response: string,
    confidence: number,
    timestamp: DateTime
  },
  experience: {
    relevant_context: Array<Citation>,
    pattern_matches: Array<Pattern>,
    historical_insights: Array<Insight>
  },
  intention: {
    goals: Array<Goal>,
    constraints: Array<Constraint>,
    expected_outcomes: Array<Outcome>
  },
  observation: {
    self_analysis: Analysis,
    pattern_recognition: Array<Pattern>,
    quality_metrics: Metrics
  },
  update: {
    refinements: Array<Refinement>,
    learning_points: Array<Learning>,
    evolution: StateTransition
  },
  yield: {
    final_response: string,
    citations: Array<Citation>,
    confidence: number
  }
}
```
