## System Invariants

1. **Thread Resonance**
   - Thread MUST maintain at least one coupled oscillator (co-author)
   - Sum of all equity shares MUST equal 1.0
   - Equity shares MUST follow quantum harmonic scaling (√n)
   - Only coupled oscillators MAY measure wave states (approve/deny)

2. **Wave Function Integrity**
   - Each message MUST have unique quantum state (content hash)
   - Stake amount MAY be any positive value
   - Equity share MUST be proportional to √(stake/P₀)
   - Base price P₀ MUST follow quantum oscillator equation

3. **Energy Conservation**
   - Total system energy MUST remain constant (10 billion tokens)
   - Approval rewards MUST distribute by equity shares
   - Denials MUST increase thread temperature
   - Split decisions MUST split energy between thread and treasury

## State Transition Rules

1. **Cavity Creation**
   ```python
   INVARIANT create_thread(creator, stake) -> cavity:
     cavity.oscillators = [creator]
     cavity.equity_map = {creator: 1.0}
     cavity.energy = 0
     cavity.temperature = initial_temp
     EMITS CavityCreated
   ```

2. **Stake Submission**
   ```python
   INVARIANT submit_stake(author, cavity, stake) -> packet:
     base_price = calculate_base_price(cavity.T, cavity.ω)
     equity = (1/N) * sqrt(stake/base_price)
     packet.potential_equity = equity
     packet.expires_at = now() + 7 days
     EMITS StakeSubmitted
   ```

3. **Approval Distribution**
   ```python
   INVARIANT distribute_approval(cavity, stake):
     FOR EACH co_author, equity IN cavity.equity_map:
       reward = stake * equity
       co_author.balance += reward
     EMITS RewardsDistributed
   ```

4. **Denial Effects**
   ```python
   INVARIANT handle_denial(cavity, stake):
     cavity.energy += stake
     cavity.temperature = cavity.energy / len(cavity.oscillators)
     cavity.token_balance += stake
     EMITS DenialProcessed
   ```

## Security Properties

1. **Equity Control**
   - Equity distribution MUST follow quantum scaling
   - Stake amount MAY be any positive value
   - Reward distribution MUST follow equity shares
   - Temperature MUST only increase from denials

2. **Temporal Coherence**
   - Wave packets MUST collapse within 7 days
   - Equity calculations MUST use current base price
   - Temperature effects MUST be immediate
   - Rewards MUST distribute atomically

3. **Energy Security**
   - Stakes MUST be locked until measurement
   - Approval rewards MUST flow to co-authors by equity
   - Denials MUST strengthen thread cavity
   - Treasury MUST accumulate split decision energy

## Implementation Notes

NOTE equity_implementation:
"Current implementation uses √n scaling"
"Allows any positive stake amount"
"Must maintain quantum mechanical principles"

NOTE reward_distribution:
"Distributes by equity shares"
"No minimum stake requirement"
"Must preserve energy conservation"

Through these invariants, we ensure that:
- Equity follows quantum mechanical principles
- Stakes can be any positive amount
- Rewards distribute proportionally
- System maintains coherence and stability
