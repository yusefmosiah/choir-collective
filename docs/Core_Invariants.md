   - Phase transitions MUST be reversible
   - State MUST be recoverable from event history

## Implementation Notes

NOTE verification_implementation:
"Current implementation uses direct phase checking"
"May introduce automated coherence verification"
"Must maintain real-time quantum guarantees"

NOTE recovery_procedures:
"Current recovery uses phase checkpointing"
"May introduce continuous wave function backup"
"Must guarantee complete phase recovery"
