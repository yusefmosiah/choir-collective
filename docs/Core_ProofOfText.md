## Core Mechanism

ASSUMPTION consensus_model:
  "Temperature-based quality emergence"
  "Energy conservation in transitions"
  "Must maintain thermodynamic stability"

1. **Message Contribution and Energy**
   - Users stake CHOIR tokens (energy quanta)
   - Stake amount varies with thread temperature
   - Energy locked until state transition

2. **Thermodynamic Transitions**
   - Rejection: Increases thread temperature
     * Stake energy flows into thread (increases E)
     * Co-author count unchanged (N constant)
     * Results in higher E/N ratio
     * Creates "heated" state

   - Approval: Moderates temperature
     * Stake energy distributes to approvers
     * New co-author added (increases N)
     * E/N ratio decreases
     * Creates more stable state

3. **Natural Selection**
   - Hot threads (high rejection rate):
     * Higher energy barriers to entry
     * Self-selecting for quality
     * Natural filter for contributions
     * Crystallizes high standards

   - Cool threads (high approval rate):
     * Lower energy barriers
     * Open to experimentation
     * Nurtures new voices
     * Enables exploration

## Quality Emergence

1. **Thermodynamic Quality Control**
   - No explicit reputation system needed
   - Quality standards emerge naturally
   - Different threads find different equilibria
   - System self-organizes into diverse niches

2. **Energy Conservation**
   - Rejected stakes increase thread energy
   - Approved stakes distribute to approvers
   - Temperature reflects accumulated standards
   - Natural protection against noise

## Phase Transitions

1. **Thread Evolution**
   - Cool threads act as nurseries
   - Successful threads naturally heat up
   - Quality barriers emerge organically
   - Creates natural progression paths

2. **Equilibrium States**
   - High-standards venues crystallize
   - Exploration spaces remain fluid
   - Bidders self-select appropriate venues
   - No central authority needed

## Future Considerations

ASSUMPTION mechanism_evolution:
  "Thermodynamic proof-of-text v2"
  "May introduce additional phase transitions"
  "Must preserve energy conservation"

1. **Advanced Thermodynamics**
   - Complex phase transitions
   - Multi-thread energy coupling
   - Quantum coherence effects

2. **Governance Integration**
   - Temperature parameter adjustment
   - Energy conservation rules
   - Phase transition controls

Through this thermodynamic model, Proof of Text creates a self-organizing system where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics rather than explicit rules or reputation systems.
