# Choir Reference Guide

## Core Concepts

Thread
A collaborative space where value accumulates naturally through quality conversations. Like a resonant cavity, each thread develops its own energy state and natural frequency through participation.

Co-author
A thread participant with approval rights. Co-authors emerge naturally when their contributions are recognized through unanimous approval. They guide the thread's evolution and share in its growing value.

Message
A contribution to a thread that requires unanimous co-author approval to become public. Like a wave, each message has potential energy (stake) that transforms into different forms based on the approval outcome.

Premium Status
Enhanced platform capabilities including doubled rewards on both new messages and prior citations. This amplification of natural value flows rewards serious participants while strengthening team formation.

## Value Flows

Stake
Energy committed when submitting a message. The amount varies with thread temperature - hotter threads require higher stakes, creating natural quality filters.

Approval Flow
When all co-authors approve a message:
- Stake distributes to approvers
- Message becomes public
- Contributor becomes co-author
- Thread frequency increases

Denial Flow
When any co-author denies a message:
- Stake strengthens thread
- Thread temperature increases
- Quality barrier rises naturally
- Energy conserves in thread

Split Decision
When approvals are mixed:
- Approvers' share flows to Treasury
- Deniers' share strengthens thread
- Temperature evolves naturally
- System maintains balance

## Natural Patterns

Temperature
A thread's energy state that affects stake requirements:
- Hot threads (high activity) = higher stakes
- Cool threads (stable) = lower stakes
- Natural cooling over time
- Quality emerges through thermodynamics

Frequency
A thread's organizational coherence:
- Higher frequency = better organization
- Co-authors strengthen coherence
- Teams resonate naturally
- Value accumulates stably

Citation Network
How knowledge flows between threads:
- Citations create value flows
- Prior rewards strengthen connections
- Networks emerge naturally
- Collective intelligence grows

## Common Questions

Q: Why do stake requirements vary?
A: Thread temperature creates natural quality filters. Like physical systems, "hotter" threads require more energy to participate, naturally selecting for quality while "cooler" threads enable exploration.

Q: How do teams form?
A: Teams crystallize naturally around valuable threads through shared participation and success. Like molecules finding stable arrangements, teams emerge from genuine alignment rather than forced structure.

Q: Why are premium rewards doubled?
A: Premium status amplifies natural value flows, rewarding serious participants who strengthen the system. Doubled rewards on both new messages and prior citations create stronger incentives for quality contribution while maintaining natural patterns.

Q: How does thread value accumulate?
A: Threads accumulate value through:
- Quality contributions
- Denial energy
- Citation rewards
- Natural resonance
This creates sustainable value growth that benefits all participants.

Q: What makes citations valuable?
A: Citations create knowledge flows between threads, strengthening both source and destination. The Treasury funds perpetual citation rewards, enabling sustainable value flow through the knowledge network.

## Best Practices

Quality Emergence
- Contribute authentically
- Judge carefully
- Build on prior work
- Let patterns emerge

Team Formation
- Find resonant threads
- Participate genuinely
- Share in success
- Grow naturally

Value Creation
- Focus on quality
- Strengthen connections
- Enable emergence
- Trust the process

## Technical Terms

Thread ID
Unique identifier for each thread cavity

Message Hash
Unique fingerprint verifying message integrity

Token Amount
Quantized unit of platform energy

Treasury
System reserve enabling perpetual rewards

## Platform States

Thread States
- Creating (formation)
- Active (participation)
- Voting (message evaluation)
- Processing (state transition)

Message States
- Pending (awaiting approval)
- Approved (public)
- Denied (rejected)
- Processing (transitioning)

User States
- Basic (standard participation)
- Premium (enhanced rewards)
- Active (in thread)
- Transitioning (state change)

Through these patterns and practices, Choir enables natural collaboration, sustainable value creation, and the emergence of collective intelligence.
