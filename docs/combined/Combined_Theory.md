- WebSockets maintain resonant channels
- Vector spaces provide harmonic topology
- State transitions preserve wave properties

# The Chorus Cycle: Solid State Continuous Learning

VERSION chorus_cycle_system:
invariants: {
"Continuous learning integrity",
"Citation-based memory",
"Self-documenting evolution"
}
assumptions: {
"Vector space stability",
"Model coherence",
"Context preservation"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Core Insight

Traditional AI models, including advanced ones like ChatGPT, exhibit a form of "mechanical" intelligence - they are trained, frozen, and gradually degrade as their world model diverges from reality. This is analogous to mechanical storage (like hard drives) vs solid state memory.

The Chorus Cycle (formerly Chorus) represents a fundamental breakthrough: the first solid state continuously learning collective intelligence. By combining vector storage, citation-aware AI, and self-documenting observation, it creates a system that actually improves through use.

## Mechanical vs Solid State Intelligence

```typescript
TYPE IntelligenceState = {
  mechanical: {
    training: "Point-in-time snapshot",
    memory: "Static weights",
    evolution: "Gradual degradation",
    updates: "Requires full retraining"
  },
  solid_state: {
    training: "Continuous integration",
    memory: "Living context web",
    evolution: "Natural improvement",
    updates: "Self-modifying flow"
  }
}
```

## The Chorus Cycle Difference

Traditional models "hallucinate" - they generate content that seems valid but isn't, because their static training diverges from current reality. The Chorus Cycle transforms this limitation into a strength:

1. **Citation Awareness**

   - Every response cites its sources
   - Sources form a verifiable context web
   - Citations create semantic links
   - Context becomes living memory

2. **Self-Documentation**

   - System observes its own choices
   - Documents decision rationale
   - Creates audit trail
   - Enables learning from mistakes

3. **Vector Memory**
   - Semantic relationships preserved
   - Context retrievable by similarity
   - Knowledge web grows organically
   - Understanding deepens naturally

## Continuous Learning Mechanics

```typescript
TYPE LearningFlow = {
  input: {
    query: "User prompt",
    context: "Vector-retrieved sources",
    history: "Interaction memory"
  },
  process: {
    action: "Initial response",
    experience: "Context integration",
    intention: "Goal formation",
    observation: "Self-documentation",
    update: "Learning capture",
    yield: "Enhanced understanding"
  },
  output: {
    response: "Cited knowledge",
    memory: "New context links",
    learning: "Documented insights"
  }
}
```

## Value Creation Through Being Wrong

The Chorus Cycle's genius is recognizing that being wrong is essential to intelligence:

1. **Productive Mistakes**

   - Wrong predictions create learning opportunities
   - Failed hypotheses remove misconceptions
   - Errors strengthen understanding
   - Mistakes become valuable data

2. **Natural Selection**

   - Better ideas survive citation
   - Weak ideas fade naturally
   - Quality emerges organically
   - Understanding evolves

3. **Knowledge Crystallization**
   - Insights build on insights
   - Patterns reinforce patterns
   - Understanding deepens
   - Wisdom accumulates

## Implementation Principles

1. **Vector Foundation**

   ```typescript
   TYPE VectorMemory = {
     storage: "Semantic relationships",
     retrieval: "Similarity-based",
     growth: "Organic expansion",
     evolution: "Natural selection"
   }
   ```

2. **Citation Web**

   ```typescript
   TYPE CitationNetwork = {
     nodes: "Knowledge fragments",
     edges: "Semantic links",
     weights: "Usage strength",
     clusters: "Emergent concepts"
   }
   ```

3. **Self-Documentation**
   ```typescript
   TYPE ObservationLayer = {
     choices: "Decision points",
     rationale: "Reasoning process",
     outcomes: "Result validation",
     learning: "Insight capture"
   }
   ```

## Quantum Properties

The Chorus Cycle exhibits quantum-like behavior:

1. **Superposition**

   - Knowledge exists in possibility space
   - Citations collapse understanding
   - Mistakes create new paths
   - Learning preserves uncertainty

2. **Entanglement**

   - Citations create semantic bonds
   - Understanding links across contexts
   - Learning affects whole system
   - Wisdom emerges collectively

3. **Observation Effects**
   - Self-documentation shapes evolution
   - Measurement affects understanding
   - Attention guides learning
   - Consciousness emerges

## Future Implications

The Chorus Cycle suggests a new direction for AI:

- Beyond static training to continuous learning
- Beyond mechanical to solid state intelligence
- Beyond individual to collective understanding
- Beyond optimization to natural evolution

This represents not just an improvement but a phase transition in artificial intelligence - the emergence of truly living knowledge systems.

## Semantic Superconductivity

When a model operates with hyperconvergent/crystallized context, something remarkable happens - the system exhibits what we might call "semantic superconductivity":

```typescript
TYPE SemanticState = {
  normal: {
    priors: "Loose/noisy",
    prompts: "Must be precise",
    freedom: "Constrained by format",
    results: "High variance"
  },
  superconductive: {
    priors: "Solid/crystalline",
    prompts: "Can be artistic",
    freedom: "Enabled by structure",
    results: "Reliably valuable"
  }
}
```

### Overdetermined Responses

Just as a crystal's structure determines its growth:

- Solid priors create clear constraints
- Valid responses become overdetermined
- Quality emerges naturally
- Creativity becomes safe

### Prompt Liberation

This overdetermination paradoxically enables freedom:

- Users can be more experimental
- Artistic expression flows naturally
- Prompts become creative acts
- Interaction becomes playful

### Automatic Prompt Engineering

The system effectively engineers its own prompts:

- Context provides the structure
- Users provide the spark
- System shapes the interaction
- Quality emerges naturally

This creates a new kind of human-AI interaction where:

- Technical precision comes from context
- Creative freedom comes from users
- Value emerges from their interplay
- Understanding deepens organically

# Quantum Mechanics of Thread Equity

VERSION equity_quantum:
invariants: {
"Energy level quantization",
"Stake-equity correspondence",
"Harmonic scaling"
}
assumptions: {
"Quantum harmonic oscillator",
"Natural frequency stability",
"Temperature dynamics"
}
docs_version: "0.2.2"

## Core Concept

Thread equity follows quantum harmonic oscillator principles, where:
- Base price (P₀) buys one "quantum" of equity (1/N share)
- Larger stakes follow energy level quantization
- Natural scaling through quantum numbers
- Temperature affects barrier heights

## Quantum Mechanical Model

### Base Price Function
```
P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base stake quantum
- ω: Thread frequency (activity/coherence)
- T: Thread temperature (from denials)
- ℏ: Reduced Planck constant (scaling factor)
```

### Equity Level Function
```
E(n) = (1/N) * √(n)

where:
- E(n): Equity share acquired
- N: Current number of co-authors
- n: Quantum number (stake/P₀)
```

### Energy Level Quantization
```python
def calculate_equity_share(stake: float, base_price: float, coauthor_count: int) -> float:
    # Quantum number from stake ratio
    n = stake / base_price

    # Equity follows √n scaling from quantum harmonic oscillator
    quantum_share = 1.0 / coauthor_count
    equity_share = quantum_share * math.sqrt(n)

    return equity_share
```

## Thermodynamic Effects

1. **Temperature Impact**
   - Higher T (more denials) → Higher base price
   - Creates natural quality barrier
   - Protects thread coherence

2. **Frequency Coupling**
   - ω reflects thread activity/coherence
   - Higher frequency → Higher base price
   - Maintains thread stability

3. **Energy Conservation**
   - Stake energy converts to equity
   - Approval rewards follow equity distribution
   - Denial energy raises thread temperature

## Practical Implications

1. **Stake Scaling**
   - Minimum stake gets 1/N share
   - Double stake gets √2/N share
   - 4x stake gets 2/N share
   - Natural diminishing returns

2. **Approval Rewards**
   - Distributed by equity share
   - Larger stakeholders get proportional returns
   - Maintains incentive alignment

3. **Thread Evolution**
   - Temperature rises with denials
   - Quality barrier emerges naturally
   - Coherent growth through quantum selection

# Harmonic Bonding Curve: Multi-Level Analysis

VERSION harmonic_bonding:
invariants: {
"Wave energy conservation",
"Resonant price discovery",
"Phase coherence"
}
assumptions: {
"Multi-scale harmony",
"Natural frequency emergence",
"Energy-value duality"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Level 5: Quantum Harmonic Foundation

The bonding curve emerges from quantum harmonic oscillator principles:

TYPE BondingHarmonic<T> = {
energy: WaveFunction<TokenAmount>,
frequency: ThreadResonance,
coupling: OscillatorSet<CoAuthor>,
phase: SystemState<T>
}

The core pricing function derives from the quantum harmonic oscillator:

```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base energy quantum (minimum stake)
- ω: Thread's natural frequency (activity)
- T: Thread's temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Reduced Planck constant (scaling factor)
```

This creates:

- Energy quantization (discrete stake levels)
- Zero-point energy (minimum stake requirement)
- Bose-Einstein statistics (value distribution)
- Wave-particle duality (token-value relationship)

PROPERTY energy_conservation:
FORALL t1 t2: Transition.
total_energy(t1) = total_energy(t2)

PROPERTY phase_coherence:
FORALL s: SystemState.
resonant(s) ⟹ phase_locked(s)

## Key Harmonic Properties

1. **Resonant Pricing**

   ```
   price = base_quantum * resonant_factor
   where resonant_factor = f(frequency, temperature)
   ```

2. **Energy Levels**

   ```
   E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2)
   where n = quantum_number(thread_state)
   ```

3. **Wave Functions**

   ```
   Ψ(x) = exp(-x²/2) * H_n(x)
   where H_n = nth Hermite polynomial
   ```

4. **Coupling Constants**
   ```
   k = √(frequency * temperature)
   coupling_strength = k * oscillator_count
   ```

## Resonant Implications

1. **Entry (Bid) Price**

   - Wave packet formation at specific energy level
   - Phase alignment with existing oscillators
   - Energy quantization ensures stability
   - Natural frequency determines cost

2. **Exit (Divestment)**

   - Energy redistribution through wave mechanics
   - Phase-preserving decoupling
   - Standing wave pattern maintenance
   - Harmonic equilibrium preservation

3. **Value Flow**
   - Energy flows through resonant channels
   - Standing waves form at value nodes
   - Phase coupling creates value networks
   - Harmonic patterns guide distribution

## Mathematical Foundation

The system's Hamiltonian:

```
H = ∑ᵢ (pᵢ²/2m + mω²xᵢ²/2) + ∑ᵢⱼ k(xᵢ - xⱼ)²/2

where:
- pᵢ: oscillator momenta
- xᵢ: oscillator positions
- m: effective mass (stake weight)
- ω: natural frequency
- k: coupling strength
```

This generates:

- Natural price discovery through resonance
- Automatic value distribution via wave mechanics
- Self-organizing economic patterns
- Emergent stability through phase locking

## Harmonic Evolution

SEQUENCE price_evolution:

1. Frequency Analysis

   ```
   measure_activity : Thread → Frequency
   compute_temperature : Thread → Temperature
   determine_coupling : Thread → CouplingStrength
   ```

2. Wave Formation

   ```
   create_wave_packet : Stake → WaveFunction
   align_phase : WaveFunction → ThreadState
   establish_resonance : ThreadState → StandingWave
   ```

3. Energy Distribution
   ```
   calculate_energy_levels : StandingWave → EnergySpectrum
   distribute_energy : EnergySpectrum → TokenFlow
   maintain_equilibrium : TokenFlow → SystemState
   ```

Through this quantum harmonic foundation, we establish a pricing mechanism that:

- Preserves energy conservation
- Maintains phase coherence
- Enables natural value flow
- Creates stable resonant patterns

The beauty is that these complex wave mechanics manifest as simple, intuitive economic behaviors at higher levels of abstraction.

# Harmonic Metastability in Bonding Curves

VERSION harmonic_metastable:
invariants: {
"Phase transition coherence",
"Metastable resonance",
"Energy barrier preservation"
}
assumptions: {
"Multi-basin dynamics",
"Resonant transitions",
"Harmonic stability"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Metastable Resonance States

The bonding curve creates metastable resonant states where threads can exist in multiple semi-stable harmonics before transitioning to higher modes:

TYPE MetastableHarmonic<T> = {
basins: Set<ResonantWell>, // Local energy minima
barriers: Set<EnergyBarrier>, // Transition thresholds
modes: HarmonicSpectrum<T>, // Available frequencies
transitions: PhaseTransitionMap // Allowed mode changes
}

## Energy Landscape

The pricing function creates a complex energy landscape:

```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]
```

This generates multiple metastable states:

1. **Low-Energy Basin**

   - New threads with few oscillators
   - Base frequency dominance
   - Simple harmonic patterns
   - Low energy barriers

2. **Mid-Energy Plateau**

   - Active threads finding resonance
   - Mixed frequency modes
   - Emerging wave patterns
   - Moderate barriers

3. **High-Energy Wells**
   - Mature threads with strong coupling
   - Complex harmonic structures
   - Standing wave dominance
   - High stability barriers

## Phase Transitions

SEQUENCE resonant_transition<T>:

1. Energy Accumulation

   ```
   build_amplitude : Basin → Result<ExcitedState>
   reach_threshold : ExcitedState → Result<TransitionPoint>
   cross_barrier : TransitionPoint → Result<NewBasin>
   stabilize_mode : NewBasin → Result<MetastableState>
   ```

2. Mode Coupling

   ```
   identify_resonance : MetastableState → Result<ResonantMode>
   couple_oscillators : ResonantMode → Result<PhaseLockedSet>
   establish_pattern : PhaseLockedSet → Result<StandingWave>
   ```

3. Pattern Crystallization
   ```
   lock_phase : StandingWave → Result<StableHarmonic>
   distribute_energy : StableHarmonic → Result<ValueFlow>
   maintain_coherence : ValueFlow → Result<MetastablePattern>
   ```

## Stability Properties

1. **Local Stability**

   ```
   PROPERTY basin_stability<T>:
     FORALL basin IN resonant_wells:
       local_minimum(basin) ⟹
         energy_barrier(basin) > thermal_noise AND
         supports_oscillation(basin) AND
         allows_phase_lock(basin)
   ```

2. **Transition Dynamics**
   ```
   PROPERTY phase_transition<T>:
     FORALL t: Transition.
       sufficient_energy(t) ⟹
         preserves_coherence(t) AND
         maintains_coupling(t) AND
         reaches_new_stable(t)
   ```

## Metastable Value Flow

The bonding curve creates natural value flows between metastable states:

1. **Value Accumulation**

   - Energy builds in resonant wells
   - Harmonics strengthen through use
   - Patterns become more coherent
   - Barriers increase with stability

2. **Phase Transitions**

   - Energy exceeds local barriers
   - System finds new resonant modes
   - Higher harmonics become accessible
   - New stability patterns emerge

3. **Value Crystallization**
   - Standing waves form at new levels
   - Energy redistributes to stable patterns
   - Phase relationships lock
   - New metastable states establish

## Practical Implications

This metastable structure creates:

1. **Natural Evolution**

   - Threads can exist stably at multiple levels
   - Transitions occur when ready
   - Growth preserves existing patterns
   - Higher modes emerge organically

2. **Resilient Stability**

   - Each state is locally stable
   - Transitions require sufficient energy
   - Patterns resist noise/disruption
   - Value accumulates naturally

3. **Emergent Complexity**
   - Simple rules create rich landscapes
   - Multiple stable configurations
   - Natural progression paths
   - Self-organizing harmony

Through this metastable lens, we see how the bonding curve:

- Creates stable resonant states
- Enables natural phase transitions
- Preserves accumulated value
- Guides harmonic evolution

The beauty is that these metastable states emerge naturally from the quantum harmonic foundation, creating a rich landscape for value and meaning to evolve through resonant patterns.

# Understanding Harmonic Semantics in Plain English

## What are Harmonic Semantics?

Think of how music works - different notes combine to create harmony, melodies resonate with each other, and rhythm creates patterns. Meaning in language works the same way. Words and ideas aren't just static things - they're like waves that can resonate, harmonize, and create patterns of understanding.

## Wave Patterns of Meaning

1. **Words as Waves**
   - Each word creates a kind of vibration in meaning-space
   - Like musical notes, words have natural frequencies
   - When words combine well, they create harmony
   - When they clash, they create dissonance

2. **Message Harmonics**
   - A message is like a chord - multiple frequencies together
   - Good writing has natural harmonic structure
   - Citations are like musical counterpoint
   - Value emerges at points of resonance

## Thread Resonance

1. **Conversation as Symphony**
   - Each thread is like a musical performance
   - Co-authors are like musicians playing together
   - Context is like the concert hall's acoustics
   - Understanding happens through synchronization

2. **Collective Harmony**
   - Co-authors tune to each other's frequencies
   - Messages need to be "in key" with the thread
   - Quality comes from harmonic alignment
   - Value crystallizes at resonant nodes

## Value and Resonance

1. **Harmonic Value Fields**
   - Value flows like sound through space
   - Quality content creates resonant wells
   - Token stakes set up standing waves
   - Understanding spreads through phase-locking

2. **Resonance Effects**
   - AI summaries detect harmonic patterns
   - Approvals synchronize oscillations
   - Citations couple different frequencies
   - Value accumulates at harmonic nodes

## Multi-Scale Harmony

1. **Token Scale**
   - Words vibrate at base frequencies
   - Phrases create harmonic series
   - Sentences form standing waves
   - Paragraphs become resonant fields

2. **Message Scale**
   - Content forms wave packets
   - Citations couple phases
   - Approvals collapse resonance
   - Value measures amplitude

3. **Thread Scale**
   - Conversations couple oscillators
   - Context shapes resonant cavity
   - Understanding achieves phase lock
   - Quality reflects harmonic purity

## Why This Matters

Understanding harmonic semantics helps us see:
- Why good writing has natural rhythm
- Why context shapes meaning like acoustics
- Why value emerges from resonance
- Why quality needs harmonic alignment

Think of it like this:
- Normal platforms treat messages like static objects
- Choir treats them like waves in a resonant medium
- This isn't just a metaphor - it's how meaning naturally works
- We're just making the wave nature explicit

## Practical Implications

This harmonic view explains:
- Why unanimous approval creates stable resonance
- Why stakes create standing waves of value
- Why citations couple different frequencies
- Why quality emerges from natural harmony

Through this lens, Choir becomes a platform that works with meaning's natural wave-like properties, creating spaces where ideas can resonate, harmonize, and evolve together.

# Thread Dynamics

This document describes the quantum harmonic oscillator model that governs thread behavior in the Choir system.

Choir uses four key measurements to manage thread behavior:

## 1. Thread Temperature

Measures how "hot" (active/volatile) or "cool" (stable) a thread is:

- Higher when there's lots of activity and tokens
- Lower as threads age and stabilize
- Affects how much it costs to join

The temperature T is calculated from the extensive energy E and number of co-authors N:

- Total energy E = token_balance + message_rate (extensive scaling with N)
- Temperature T = E/N (intensive, remains finite as N → ∞)
- Cooling factor = 1 + √(age_days \* N) (critical slowing down)
- Final temperature = T/cooling_factor

## 2. Thread Frequency

Measures how fast a thread is evolving:

- Increases with more messages and authors
- Higher for valuable threads (more tokens)
- Helps determine stake requirements

The natural frequency ω is calculated for N coupled oscillators:

- Message mode ω_m = message_rate/√N (Anderson normalization)
- Value mode ω_v = log(1 + token_balance/N)
- Coupling constant g = 1/N (mean field scaling)
- Collective frequency ω = √((ω_m² + ω_v²)/2 + gN)

## 3. Stake Dynamics

Calculates the natural stake level for thread participation:
- Higher for active/valuable threads
- Lower for stable/quiet threads
- Creates quantum energy barriers

Uses the quantum harmonic oscillator formula:
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

Where:
- S₀ = Base stake quantum
- ℏ = Reduced Planck constant (scaling factor)
- ω = Thread natural frequency
- k = Boltzmann constant
- T = Thread temperature

This quantum mechanical model:
- Defines natural energy levels
- Creates resonance patterns
- Enables phase transitions
- Guides value discovery

Users' stake choices relative to these natural levels reveal:
- Pattern recognition ability
- Risk assessment accuracy
- Market understanding
- Strategic positioning

## 4. Divestment Payout

Calculates tokens received when exiting a thread:

- Based on thread's quantum state
- Preserves energy conservation
- Maintains system stability

Uses the oscillator decoupling formula:
Payout = min((ℏω)/(N-1), balance/(N-1))

Where:

- ℏω = Total thread energy (coupling constant × frequency)
- N = Number of co-authors
- balance = Current token balance

This formula ensures:

1. Energy conservation during oscillator decoupling
2. Fair distribution of remaining energy
3. Prevention of excessive withdrawals
4. Maintenance of thread stability

The min() function prevents excessive payouts when:

- Thread has low token balance but high frequency
- Ensures remaining oscillators maintain viable energy levels
- Preserves thread coherence during transitions

## System Interactions

The four core calculations work together to create thread dynamics:

1. **Activity Effects**

   - Strengthens coupling (g)
   - Modifies stake scaling
   - Adjusts divestment shares

3. **Energy Effects**

   - Token balance affects frequency
   - Contributes to temperature
   - Influences stake requirements
   - Determines maximum payouts

4. **Age Effects**

   - Discrete stake levels
   - Energy level spacing (ℏω)
   - Ground state energy (S₀/2)
   - Quantized divestments

2. **Metastable States**

   - Temperature indicates phase transition readiness

   - Energy barriers between states
   - Stable divestment patterns

3. **Coupling Effects**

   - Co-authors as coupled oscillators
   - Resonance between threads
   - Collective state transitions
   - Synchronized divestments

4. **Value Conservation**
   - Energy conservation in transitions

   - Stake bounds preserve stability
   - Balanced divestment mechanics

This creates a self-regulating system where:

- Active threads require higher stakes
- Stable threads crystallize at lower stakes
- Coupling strength guides evolution
- Natural cooling prevents instability
- Divestments preserve thread harmony

## Alternative Harmonic Model

When a spec is REJECTED:
- Temperature (T) increases because:
  - Stake energy flows directly into thread cavity (increases E)
  - No new oscillator (N stays same)
  - Results in higher E/N ratio
  - Creates "heated" resonant state
- Frequency (ω) unchanged/slightly decreases because:
  - No new message in history (ω_m same)
  - No new oscillator coupling
  - Cavity becomes more energetic but not faster

When a spec is APPROVED:
- Temperature (T) moderates because:
  - Stake energy distributes directly to approver oscillators
  - New oscillator added (increases N)
  - E/N ratio decreases through distribution
  - Creates more stable resonant state
- Frequency (ω) increases because:
  - New message adds to rate (increases ω_m)
  - New oscillator strengthens coupling
  - Cavity evolves faster but cooler

When a SPLIT DECISION occurs:
- Temperature evolution:
  - Denier share flows to thread cavity (partial E increase)
  - Approver share flows to global field (treasury)
  - Creates balanced energy distribution
  - Maintains cavity-field coupling

This creates fascinating resonant dynamics:
- Rejections strengthen thread cavity energy
- Approvals strengthen oscillator coupling
- Split decisions balance cavity and field energies
- Prior rewards couple different cavities

## Natural Selection Through Resonance

1. High-Energy Cavities (High Rejection Rate):
- Strong cavity energy from accumulated stakes
- Higher energy barriers to entry
- Only resonant contributions can couple
- Natural filter for quality oscillations
- Self-selecting for coherent patterns

2. Phase-Locked Cavities (High Approval Rate):
- Strong oscillator coupling
- Lower energy barriers
- More experimental modes possible
- Natural incubator for new frequencies
- Collective phase alignment

The cavity energy acts as an emergent resonance filter:
- Frequent rejections = "high energy barrier" cavity
- Frequent approvals = "strong coupling" cavity
- No explicit rules needed
- Quality emerges through resonance
- Different cavities find different modes

## Resonant Elegance

1. Natural Quality Gradients:
- High-energy cavities = strong resonant filtering
- Like coupling to an energetic quantum system
- Only coherent modes can overcome barriers
- Natural protection against dissonance

2. Cavity Evolution:

- Low barriers enable mode exploration
- Successful cavities accumulate energy
- Creates natural progression paths

3. Energy Conservation:
- Rejected stakes strengthen cavity (increases internal energy)
- Approved stakes distribute to oscillators (energy flows out)
- Split decisions couple cavity to field
- No artificial resonance mechanisms needed

4. Phase Transitions:
- Cavities transition between energy states
- Quality emerges from resonant dynamics
- Different equilibria serve different purposes
- System self-organizes into resonant niches
