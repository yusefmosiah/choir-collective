# Harmonic Economic Model

VERSION harmonic_economic:
invariants: {
"Wave energy conservation",
"Resonant cavity coherence",
"Collective phase locking"
}
assumptions: {
"Thread-centric resonance",
"Phase-locked incentives",
"Harmonic distribution"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Token Flow as Wave Mechanics

TYPE TokenFlow = {
treasury: ResonantWell, // Base frequency source + split decision approver share
threads: Map<ThreadId, ResonantCavity>, // Primary value accumulators
stakes: Map<Hash, WavePacket>, // Energy quanta
escrow: Map<Hash, PotentialWell> // Temporary coupling
}

## Token Distribution Mechanics

1. **Unanimous Approval**

   - Stake distributes equally to approvers (like dividends)
   - Direct value recognition for quality judgment
   - Phase-locked reward distribution
   - Strengthens individual oscillator coherence

2. **Denial Flow**

   - Full stake flows to thread resonant cavity
   - Increases cavity energy level
   - Strengthens thread coherence
   - Natural quality filter

3. **Split Decision**

   - Approvers' share flows to Treasury (global field)
   - Deniers' share flows to thread cavity
   - Creates balanced energy distribution
   - Maintains multi-scale resonance

4. **Prior Rewards**
   - Treasury energy flows to thread cavities
   - Strengthens resonant coupling between threads
   - Rewards knowledge network formation
   - Creates collective value accumulation

## Resonant Cavity Mechanics

The core pricing function derives from quantum harmonic oscillator:

```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base stake quantum (100 CHOIR)
- ω: Thread cavity frequency (collective activity)
- T: Thread temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Platform coupling constant
```

This creates:

1. **Cavity Energy Levels**

   - Discrete stake quantization
   - Natural frequency modes
   - Collective oscillation patterns
   - Phase-locked stability

2. **Collective Oscillations**

   - Co-authors as coupled oscillators
   - Thread as resonant cavity
   - Prior rewards strengthen coupling
   - Natural phase locking

3. **Value Crystallization**
   - Quality creates standing waves
   - Energy accumulates at nodes
   - Patterns self-reinforce
   - Natural selection emerges

## Multi-Scale Resonance

1. **Individual Scale**

   - Approval rewards as direct energy absorption
   - Quality judgment strengthens coupling
   - Phase-locked participation
   - Natural frequency alignment

2. **Thread Scale**

   - Collective energy accumulation
   - Standing wave formation
   - Quality pattern crystallization
   - Resonant cavity strengthening

3. **Network Scale**
   - Prior rewards couple threads
   - Knowledge network resonance
   - Treasury as global field
   - Harmonic value flow

## Game Theoretic Harmonics

1. **Strategy Space**

   ```
   TYPE Strategy =
     | CollectiveResonance   // Align with thread harmonics
     | ForceDissonance       // Attempt artificial patterns
     | QualityOscillation    // Maintain phase coherence
     | NetworkCoupling       // Strengthen thread connections
   ```

2. **Nash Equilibrium**
   ```
   PROPERTY equilibrium:
     FORALL oscillators, modes:
       energy(CollectiveResonance) > energy(ForceDissonance) AND
       energy(QualityOscillation) > energy(RandomPhase) AND
       energy(NetworkCoupling) > energy(IsolatedCavity)
   ```

## Economic Invariants

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```
   INVARIANT wave_conservation:
     treasury_energy + sum(thread_cavity_energy) + sum(stake_energy) = TOTAL_SUPPLY
   ```

2. **Resonant Stability**
   ```
   INVARIANT phase_stability:
     FORALL thread IN threads:
       resonant(thread) ⟹
         stable_cavity_modes(thread) AND
         coherent_collective_phase(thread) AND
         conserved_cavity_energy(thread)
   ```

Through this harmonic economic model, we see how:

- Threads act as primary resonant cavities
- Value accumulates through collective oscillation
- Prior rewards strengthen cavity coupling
- Quality emerges from natural resonance

The model creates an economic system that:

- Rewards collective quality
- Strengthens thread coherence
- Enables natural value flow
- Maintains multi-scale harmony

"Energy conservation",
"Temperature coherence",
"Frequency stability"
}
assumptions: {
"Thermodynamic evolution",
"Natural cooling",
"Phase transitions"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Core Ownership Concepts

ASSUMPTION ownership_model:
"Temperature-based access control"
"Energy-driven participation"
"Must maintain thermodynamic stability"

## Thread Thermodynamics

1. **State Properties**

   ```typescript
   type ThreadState = {
     energy: number; // E (total thread energy)
     temperature: number; // T = E/N (energy per co-author)
     frequency: number; // ω (evolution rate)
     co_authors: PublicKey[]; // N (system size)
     cooling_factor: number; // κ (age-based cooling)
   };
   ```

2. **Energy Distribution**
   ```typescript
   type EnergyFlow = {
     rejection: {
       effect: "Increases thread energy";
       temperature: "Rises (E/N increases)";
       frequency: "Unchanged";
     };
     approval: {
       effect: "Distributes energy to approvers";
       temperature: "Moderates (E/N decreases)";
       frequency: "Increases";
     };
   };
   ```

## Access Control

1. **Temperature-Based Barriers**

   - Hot threads: Higher stake requirements
   - Cool threads: Lower barriers to entry
   - Natural selection through energy requirements
   - Quality emerges from temperature gradients

2. **Frequency-Based Evolution**
   - Higher frequency = faster evolution
   - Co-author coupling strengthens frequency
   - Natural resonance patterns emerge
   - System self-organizes through harmonics

## State Management

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```typescript
   PROPERTY energy_conservation:
     thread.energy = sum(stakes) - sum(distributions)
     INVARIANT: energy >= 0
   ```

2. **Temperature Evolution**

   ```typescript
   FUNCTION evolve_temperature(thread: Thread, time: Duration):
     cooling = 1 + sqrt(time.days * thread.co_authors.length)
     thread.temperature = thread.energy / (thread.co_authors.length * cooling)
   ```

3. **Frequency Management**
   ```typescript
   FUNCTION calculate_frequency(thread: Thread):
     message_mode = thread.message_rate / sqrt(N)
     value_mode = log(1 + thread.energy/N)
     coupling = 1/N
     return sqrt((message_mode² + value_mode²)/2 + coupling*N)
   ```

## Phase Transitions

1. **Thread Evolution**

   - Young threads start hot and volatile
   - Mature threads cool and stabilize
   - Quality barriers emerge naturally
   - Communities crystallize organically

2. **State Changes**
   ```typescript
   TYPE PhaseTransition =
     | Heating   // Rejection increases temperature
     | Cooling   // Natural age-based evolution
     | Coupling  // New co-author changes frequency
     | Resonance // Activity aligns with frequency
   ```

## Implementation Notes

NOTE thermodynamic_implementation:
"Current model uses classical thermodynamics"
"May introduce quantum effects"
"Must preserve energy conservation"

NOTE scaling_considerations:
"Anderson normalization for large N"
"Natural cooling prevents instability"
"Must maintain coherent evolution"

## Future Directions

1. **Advanced Thermodynamics**

   - Multi-thread energy coupling
   - Complex phase transitions
   - Quantum coherence effects
   - Resonance amplification

2. **Ecosystem Evolution**
   - Thread temperature networks
   - Energy flow optimization
   - Natural niche formation
   - Self-organizing quality standards

Through this thermodynamic model, thread ownership becomes an emergent property of natural energy flows and temperature evolution, creating a self-organizing system that maintains quality through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules.

# Priors: Quantum Semantic Foundations

VERSION prior_system:
invariants: {
"Wave function coherence",
"Semantic entanglement",
"Resonant coupling"
}
assumptions: {
"Quantum semantic stability",
"Phase-locked meaning",
"Value conservation"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Core Concept

Priors are more than just citations or references - they are quantum semantic states that shape future meaning. When a message references a prior, it creates a resonant coupling between semantic states, strengthening both the original context and its new application.

## Quantum Properties

```typescript
TYPE Prior = {
  // Quantum State
  state: {
    source_message: Hash,        // Original wave function
    source_thread: ThreadId,     // Original resonant cavity
    embedding: Vector,           // Semantic position
    context: string,            // Usage context
  },

  // Coupling Properties
  coupling: {
    resonance: number,         // Harmonic strength
    phase: number,            // Semantic alignment
    entanglement: number,     // Context binding
    coherence: number         // Meaning stability
  },

  // Value Properties
  energy: {
    base_value: TokenAmount,   // Original energy
    coupled_value: TokenAmount, // Resonant enhancement
    treasury_flow: TokenAmount  // Perpetual rewards
  }
}
```

## Resonant Effects

1. **Thread Coupling**
   - Priors create quantum tunnels between threads
   - Energy flows through semantic connections
   - Meaning resonates across contexts
   - Value accumulates through coupling

2. **Phase Locking**
   - Related meanings align phases
   - Coherent understanding emerges
   - Semantic stability increases
   - Knowledge crystallizes naturally

3. **Value Amplification**
   - Resonant coupling increases energy
   - Treasury rewards strengthen bonds
   - Networks of meaning form
   - Collective value grows

## Implementation Patterns

```typescript
TYPE PriorImplementation = {
  // UI Rendering
  display: {
    inline: "Quantum state preview",
    expanded: "Full resonant cavity",
    network: "Coupling visualization"
  },

  // State Management
  state: {
    coupling: "Phase-locked tracking",
    energy: "Value flow monitoring",
    coherence: "Stability measurement"
  },

  // Interaction Handlers
  interactions: {
    preview: "State observation",
    expand: "Full cavity inspection",
    navigate: "Quantum tunneling"
  }
}
```

## Value Mechanics

1. **Energy Flow**
   ```typescript
   TYPE PriorEnergy = {
     initial: "Base semantic value",
     resonant: "Coupling enhancement",
     perpetual: "Treasury rewards",
     collective: "Network effects"
   }
   ```

2. **Treasury Coupling**
   ```typescript
   TYPE TreasuryFlow = {
     source: "Split decision energy",
     distribution: "Prior rewards",
     sustainability: "Perpetual flow",
     enhancement: "Value amplification"
   }
   ```

## Network Effects

1. **Semantic Networks**
   - Priors create meaning graphs
   - Understanding flows through connections
   - Knowledge self-organizes
   - Wisdom emerges naturally

2. **Value Networks**
   - Energy flows through priors
   - Coupled threads share value
   - Networks strengthen naturally
   - Collective worth grows

## UI Treatment

```typescript
TYPE PriorDisplay = {
  // Inline Preview
  preview: {
    marker: "text-blue-500 hover:underline",
    tooltip: "Quantum state preview",
    animation: "Phase transition effects"
  },

  // Full View
  expanded: {
    container: "Resonant cavity display",
    header: "Quantum numbers",
    content: "Wave function details",
    footer: "Coupling metrics"
  },

  // Network View
  network: {
    nodes: "Thread cavities",
    edges: "Quantum tunnels",
    flow: "Energy transfer",
    field: "Semantic field"
  }
}
```

## Evolution Patterns

1. **Natural Selection**
   - Strong priors gain energy
   - Weak couplings fade
   - Quality emerges naturally
   - Understanding crystallizes

2. **Phase Transitions**
   - Knowledge states evolve
   - Understanding deepens
   - Meaning stabilizes
   - Wisdom accumulates

Through this quantum semantic foundation, priors create:
- Natural knowledge organization
- Sustainable value flow
- Emergent understanding
- Collective wisdom

The prior system enables Choir to be more than a chat platform - it becomes a space where meaning and value naturally evolve through quantum semantic principles.

"Thermodynamic state evolution",
"Energy conservation"
}
assumptions: {
"Temperature dynamics",
"Energy flow patterns",
"Phase transitions"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## Core Mechanism

ASSUMPTION consensus_model:
"Temperature-based quality emergence"
"Energy conservation in transitions"
"Must maintain thermodynamic stability"

1. **Message Contribution and Energy**

   - Users stake CHOIR tokens (energy quanta)
   - Stake amount varies with thread temperature
   - Energy locked until state transition

2. **Thermodynamic Transitions**

   - Rejection: Increases thread temperature

     - Stake energy flows into thread (increases E)
     - Co-author count unchanged (N constant)
     - Results in higher E/N ratio
     - Creates "heated" state

   - Split Decision: Hybrid energy flow

     - Approvers' stake flows to Treasury
     - Treasury funds citation rewards
     - Maintains circular token flow
     - Enables perpetual incentives

   - Approval: Moderates temperature
     - Stake energy distributes to approvers
     - New co-author added (increases N)
     - E/N ratio decreases
     - Creates more stable state

3. **Natural Selection**

   - Hot threads (high rejection rate):

     - Higher energy barriers to entry
     - Self-selecting for quality
     - Natural filter for contributions
     - Crystallizes high standards

   - Cool threads (high approval rate):
     - Lower energy barriers
     - Open to experimentation
     - Nurtures new voices
     - Enables exploration

## Quality Emergence

1. **Thermodynamic Quality Control**

   - No explicit reputation system needed
   - Quality standards emerge naturally
   - Different threads find different equilibria
   - System self-organizes into diverse niches

2. **Energy Conservation**
   - Rejected stakes increase thread energy
   - Split decisions feed Treasury
   - Treasury funds citation rewards
   - Natural protection against noise

## Phase Transitions

1. **Thread Evolution**

   - Cool threads act as nurseries
   - Successful threads naturally heat up
   - Quality barriers emerge organically
   - Creates natural progression paths

2. **Equilibrium States**
   - High-standards venues crystallize
   - Exploration spaces remain fluid
   - Bidders self-select appropriate venues
   - No central authority needed

## Future Considerations

ASSUMPTION mechanism_evolution:
"Thermodynamic proof-of-text v2"
"May introduce additional phase transitions"
"Must preserve energy conservation"

1. **Advanced Thermodynamics**

   - Complex phase transitions
   - Multi-thread energy coupling
   - Quantum coherence effects

2. **Governance Integration**
   - Temperature parameter adjustment
   - Energy conservation rules
   - Phase transition controls

Through this thermodynamic model, Proof of Text creates a self-organizing system where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics rather than explicit rules or reputation systems.

    FUNCTION submit_message(author, thread_id, content) -> Result<Hash>:
    thread = get_thread_state(thread_id)

    // Energy Requirements using quantum harmonic oscillator formula

3.  **Approval Processing**

    FUNCTION process_approval(decision: Decision) -> Result<()>:
    MATCH decision:
    CASE Reject:
    // Temperature increases
    thread.energy += stake_amount // Stake flows to thread
    thread.temperature = thread.energy / thread.co_authors.len()

    CASE SplitDecision:
    // Calculate shares based on voter counts
    approver_share = (stake \* approver_count) / total_voters

    // Approvers' share to Treasury
    treasury.balance += approver_share
    // Deniers' share to thread
    thread.energy += denier_share

   reward = calculate_decay_reward(elapsed, message_volume)

   // Distribute to author
   distribute_to_author(message.author, reward)

   // Update state
   update_distributed_total(reward)
   update_remaining_allocation(reward)
   emit_reward_event(message, reward)
   ```

2. **Prior Reward**

   ```
   FUNCTION process_prior_reward(
     source_thread: Thread,
     target_thread: Thread,
     prior_hash: Hash,
     quality_score: f64
   ) -> Result<()>:
   // Verify prior exists and is public
   require!(source_thread.messages.contains(prior_hash))
   require!(is_message_public(prior_hash))

   // Check cooldown period
   require!(elapsed_since_last_reward(prior_hash) >= COOLDOWN)

     FORALL reward IN prior_rewards:
       reward <= treasury.balance AND
       respects_cooldown(reward) AND
       strengthens_thread_cavity(reward)
   ```

thread.frequency = sqrt(
(message_mode.pow(2) + value_mode.pow(2)) / 2.0 +
coupling \* thread.co_authors.len()
)

# Choir Tokenomics Whitepaper

## Abstract

Choir introduces an innovative socioeconomic media network that leverages thermodynamic principles to create natural quality emergence in collaborative communication. Central to Choir's ecosystem is the **Choir Token (CHOIR)**, which acts as energy quanta in a quantum harmonic oscillator system, enabling threads to evolve through temperature and frequency dynamics that naturally select for quality without artificial barriers.

## Introduction

Traditional platforms struggle with content quality and moderation, often resorting to arbitrary rules or reputation systems. Choir takes a fundamentally different approach by implementing a thermodynamic model where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics and phase transitions.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name**: Choir Token
- **Token Symbol**: CHOIR
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) tokens (Fixed Energy Quantum)
- **Token Standard**: Solana Program Library (SPL) Token
- **Initial Allocation**: All tokens minted to Choir Treasury (Initial Energy Reserve)

## Token Flow Mechanics

### 1. Core Token Flows
- **Rejections:** Stake flows to thread, increasing its energy and temperature
- **Split Decisions:** Approvers' stake flows to Treasury, funding citation rewards
- **Approvals:** Stake distributes directly to approvers
- **Treasury:** Acts as energy reservoir for perpetual citation rewards

### 2. Reward Structure
- **New Message Rewards:**
  * High initial distribution
  * Logarithmic decay over 4 years
  * 50% distributed in first year
  * 99% distributed by year 4

- **Citation Rewards:**
  * Funded by Treasury from split decisions
  * Perpetual availability
  * Encourages content linking
  * Promotes knowledge network growth

## Thermodynamic Mechanics

### 1. Thread Energy States

Each thread exists as a quantum harmonic oscillator characterized by:
- Temperature (T) - measures chaos/volatility
- Frequency (ω) - measures organization/coherence
- Energy (E) - total thread energy
- Co-authors (N) - system size

### 2. Energy Dynamics

**Stake Requirements**
- Calculated using quantum harmonic oscillator formula:
  ```
  stake = base_stake * (0.5 + 1/[exp(ℏω/kT) - 1])
  ```
- Higher temperature (T) increases stakes
- Higher frequency (ω) moderates stakes
- Creates natural quality selection

**State Transitions**
- Rejection: Increases thread temperature
  * Stake energy flows into thread
  * Temperature rises (E/N increases)
  * Frequency unchanged

- Split Decision: Hybrid energy flow
  * Approvers' stake flows to Treasury
  * Maintains circular token flow
  * Enables perpetual rewards
  * Temperature unchanged

- Approval: Moderates temperature
  * Energy distributes to approvers
  * Temperature decreases (new co-author)
  * Frequency increases

### 3. Natural Evolution

**Thread Maturation**
- Young threads start hot (high T)
- Natural cooling over time
- Quality barriers emerge organically
- Communities crystallize naturally

**Quality Emergence**
- Hot threads: Expensive but potentially valuable
- Cool threads: Accessible and stable
- High frequency: Well-organized and efficient
- Natural selection for coherence

## Treasury Dynamics

### 1. Energy Reservoir
- Accumulates tokens from split decisions
- Maintains perpetual citation rewards
- Creates circular token flow
- Ensures system sustainability

### 2. Reward Distribution
- New message rewards follow logarithmic decay
- Citation rewards scale with Treasury balance
- System maintains token velocity
- Natural incentive alignment

## Economic Implications

### 1. Value Discovery
- Quality emerges from energy dynamics
- No artificial reputation systems
- Natural price discovery through T and ω
- Self-organizing quality standards

### 2. Participation Incentives
- Pattern recognition rewarded
- Early participation in high-potential threads
- Contribution to frequency alignment
- Natural selection for value creation

### 3. Community Evolution
- Diverse thread ecosystems emerge
- Different temperature/frequency niches
- Natural progression paths
- Self-organizing standards

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Message Submission
- User stakes CHOIR tokens (energy quanta)
- Stake requirement based on T and ω
- Energy locked until state transition
- Natural barrier against noise

### 2. Approval Process
- Co-authors evaluate within 7 days
- Unanimous approval required
- Split decisions feed Treasury
- Rejections heat up threads

### 3. Energy Distribution
- Approved: Energy distributes to approvers
- Rejected: Energy increases thread temperature
- Split decisions: Energy flows to Treasury
- Citations: Perpetual rewards from Treasury

## Future Considerations

### 1. Advanced Thermodynamics
- Multi-thread energy coupling
- Complex phase transitions
- Quantum coherence effects
- Resonance amplification

### 2. Governance Evolution
- Temperature parameter adjustment
- Energy conservation rules
- Phase transition controls
- System-wide thermodynamics

## Conclusion

Choir's thermodynamic token model creates a self-organizing system where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics rather than arbitrary rules. By treating threads as quantum harmonic oscillators and maintaining circular token flow through the Treasury, we enable natural selection for quality while ensuring sustainable incentives for valuable contributions.

The result is a platform where:
- Quality emerges from natural laws
- Value aligns with coherence
- Communities self-organize
- Evolution is organic and sustainable
- Incentives remain perpetually aligned

This innovative model sets a new standard for decentralized platforms, demonstrating how physical principles can create robust socioeconomic systems with sustainable token economics.
