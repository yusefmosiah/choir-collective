# Harmonic Economic Model

VERSION harmonic_economic:
invariants: {
"Wave energy conservation",
"Value resonance patterns",
"Token flow coherence"
}
assumptions: {
"Resonant pricing",
"Phase-locked incentives",
"Harmonic distribution"
}
docs_version: "0.2.0"

## Token Flow as Wave Mechanics

TYPE TokenFlow = {
treasury: ResonantWell, // Base frequency source
threads: Map<ThreadId, StandingWave>, // Resonant cavities
stakes: Map<Hash, WavePacket>, // Energy quanta
escrow: Map<Hash, PotentialWell> // Temporary coupling
}

## Bonding Curve Mechanics

The core pricing function derives from quantum harmonic oscillator:

```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base stake quantum (100 CHOIR)
- ω: Thread frequency (activity level)
- T: Thread temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Platform coupling constant
```

This creates:

1. **Entry Price (Bid)**

   ```typescript
   function calculateStakeRequired(thread: Thread): number {
     const ω = measureThreadActivity(thread)
     const T = measureThreadVolatility(thread)
     return S₀ * (0.5 + 1/(Math.exp(ω/T) - 1))
   }
   ```

2. **Exit Amount (Divestment)**

   ```typescript
   function calculateDivestmentAmount(thread: Thread): number {
     const ℏ = PLATFORM_COUPLING_CONSTANT;
     const ω = measureThreadFrequency(thread);
     const N = thread.coAuthors.length;
     const balance = thread.tokenBalance;

     // Use quantum oscillator decoupling formula
     return Math.min((ℏ * ω) / (N - 1), balance / (N - 1));
   }
   ```

## Incentive Resonance

1. **Stake Harmonics**

   ```
   PROPERTY stake_resonance:
     stake_energy > noise_threshold AND
     stake_energy < resonant_ceiling AND
     stake_energy ∝ thread_amplitude
   ```

2. **Reward Distribution**
   ```
   FUNCTION distribute_energy(action: Action) -> TokenAmount:
     MATCH action:
       Deny → energy/deniers_count        // Equal energy split
       Approve → energy/oscillator_count  // Phase-locked distribution
       Divest → total_energy/(n-1)       // Harmonic redistribution
   ```

## Game Theoretic Harmonics

1. **Strategy Space**

   ```
   TYPE Strategy =
     | NaturalResonance    // Align with thread harmonics
     | ForceDissonance     // Attempt artificial patterns
     | QualityOscillation  // Maintain phase coherence
     | CollectiveHarmony   // Synchronized denial
   ```

2. **Nash Equilibrium**
   ```
   PROPERTY equilibrium:
     FORALL oscillators, modes:
       energy(NaturalResonance) > energy(ForceDissonance) AND
       energy(QualityOscillation) > energy(RandomPhase) AND
       energy(CollectiveHarmony) > energy(UnilateralNoise)
   ```

## Economic Invariants

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```
   INVARIANT wave_conservation:
     treasury_energy + sum(thread_energy) + sum(stake_energy) = TOTAL_SUPPLY
   ```

2. **Resonant Stability**
   ```
   INVARIANT phase_stability:
     FORALL thread IN threads:
       resonant(thread) ⟹
         stable_amplitude(thread) AND
         coherent_phase(thread) AND
         conserved_energy(thread)
   ```

## Market Dynamics

1. **Thread Resonance**

   ```typescript
   function calculateThreadFrequency(thread: Thread): number {
     // Message mode frequency
     const ω_m = thread.messageRate / Math.sqrt(thread.coAuthors.length);

     // Value mode frequency
     const ω_v = Math.log(1 + thread.tokenBalance / thread.coAuthors.length);

     // Coupling constant
     const g = 1 / thread.coAuthors.length;

     // Collective frequency using Anderson normalization
     return Math.sqrt((ω_m ** 2 + ω_v ** 2) / 2 + g * thread.coAuthors.length);
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Tuning**

   ```typescript
   function calculateThreadTemperature(thread: Thread): number {
     const E = thread.tokenBalance + thread.messageRate;
     const N = thread.coAuthors.length;
     const coolingFactor = 1 + Math.sqrt(thread.ageInDays * N);

     // Temperature with critical slowing down
     return E / N / coolingFactor;
   }
   ```

## Example Scenarios

1. **New Thread**

   ```typescript
   const newThread = {
     messageRate: 2, // Low frequency
     coAuthorCount: 2, // Few oscillators
     tokenBalance: 500, // Low energy
     approvalRate: 1.0, // Perfect phase
     ageInDays: 1, // High temperature
   };
   // Results in low stake (~75 CHOIR)
   ```

2. **Active Thread**
   ```typescript
   const activeThread = {
     messageRate: 20, // High frequency
     coAuthorCount: 10, // Many oscillators
     tokenBalance: 10000, // High energy
     approvalRate: 0.8, // Good phase coherence
     ageInDays: 30, // Stable temperature
   };
   // Results in higher stake (~300 CHOIR)
   ```

## Treasury and Citation Rewards

1. **Treasury as Energy Reservoir**

   - Accumulates tokens from split decisions
   - Funds perpetual citation rewards
   - Enables circular token flow
   - Maintains system sustainability

2. **New Message Rewards**

   - High initial distribution
   - Logarithmic decay over time
   - 50% distributed in first year
   - 99% distributed by year 4

3. **Citation Rewards**
   - Funded by Treasury
   - Perpetual availability
   - Encourages content linking
   - Promotes knowledge network growth

Through this harmonic economic model, we see how:

- Value flows follow wave mechanics
- Prices emerge from resonant patterns
- Incentives align through phase-locking
- Stability comes from natural harmonics

The model creates an economic system that:

- Rewards authentic participation
- Dampens artificial behavior
- Enables natural value flow
- Maintains system coherence

- Anti-fragile (strengthens under attack)

## Competitive Implications

Attempts to compete through:

- Feature copying (misses the system)
- Economic optimization (destroys value)
- Social engineering (breaks emergence)
- Technical sophistication (adds friction)
  All strengthen Choir's advantage

## Future Evolution

The moat will:

- Deepen through natural use
- Expand through emergence
- Strengthen through selection
- Complexify through interaction

This protection isn't designed - it emerges naturally from the system's fundamental properties, making it both effortless to maintain and impossible to truly replicate.

"Energy conservation",
"Temperature coherence",
"Frequency stability"
}
assumptions: {
"Thermodynamic evolution",

"Phase transitions"
}
docs_version: "0.2.0"

## Core Ownership Concepts

ASSUMPTION ownership_model:
"Temperature-based access control"
"Energy-driven participation"
"Must maintain thermodynamic stability"

## Thread Thermodynamics

1. **State Properties**

   ```typescript
   type ThreadState = {
     energy: number; // E (total thread energy)
     temperature: number; // T = E/N (energy per co-author)
     frequency: number; // ω (evolution rate)
     co_authors: PublicKey[]; // N (system size)
     cooling_factor: number; // κ (age-based cooling)
   };
   ```

2. **Energy Distribution**
   ```typescript
   type EnergyFlow = {
     rejection: {
       effect: "Increases thread energy";
       temperature: "Rises (E/N increases)";
       frequency: "Unchanged";
     };
     approval: {
       effect: "Distributes energy to approvers";
       temperature: "Moderates (E/N decreases)";
       frequency: "Increases";
     };
   };
   ```

## Access Control

1. **Temperature-Based Barriers**

   - Hot threads: Higher stake requirements
   - Cool threads: Lower barriers to entry
   - Natural selection through energy requirements
   - Quality emerges from temperature gradients

2. **Frequency-Based Evolution**
   - Higher frequency = faster evolution
   - Co-author coupling strengthens frequency
   - Natural resonance patterns emerge
   - System self-organizes through harmonics

## State Management

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```typescript
   PROPERTY energy_conservation:
     thread.energy = sum(stakes) - sum(distributions)
     INVARIANT: energy >= 0
   ```

2. **Temperature Evolution**

   ```typescript
   FUNCTION evolve_temperature(thread: Thread, time: Duration):
     cooling = 1 + sqrt(time.days * thread.co_authors.length)
     thread.temperature = thread.energy / (thread.co_authors.length * cooling)
   ```

3. **Frequency Management**
   ```typescript
   FUNCTION calculate_frequency(thread: Thread):
     message_mode = thread.message_rate / sqrt(N)
     value_mode = log(1 + thread.energy/N)
     coupling = 1/N
     return sqrt((message_mode² + value_mode²)/2 + coupling*N)
   ```

## Phase Transitions

1. **Thread Evolution**

   - Young threads start hot and volatile
   - Mature threads cool and stabilize
   - Quality barriers emerge naturally
   - Communities crystallize organically

2. **State Changes**
   ```typescript
   TYPE PhaseTransition =
     | Heating   // Rejection increases temperature
     | Cooling   // Natural age-based evolution
     | Coupling  // New co-author changes frequency
     | Resonance // Activity aligns with frequency
   ```

## Implementation Notes

NOTE thermodynamic_implementation:
"Current model uses classical thermodynamics"
"May introduce quantum effects"
"Must preserve energy conservation"

NOTE scaling_considerations:
"Anderson normalization for large N"
"Natural cooling prevents instability"
"Must maintain coherent evolution"

## Future Directions

1. **Advanced Thermodynamics**

   - Multi-thread energy coupling
   - Complex phase transitions
   - Quantum coherence effects
   - Resonance amplification

2. **Ecosystem Evolution**
   - Thread temperature networks
   - Energy flow optimization
   - Natural niche formation
   - Self-organizing quality standards

Through this thermodynamic model, thread ownership becomes an emergent property of natural energy flows and temperature evolution, creating a self-organizing system that maintains quality through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules.

# Choir Tokenomics Whitepaper

## Abstract

Choir introduces an innovative socioeconomic media network that leverages thermodynamic principles to create natural quality emergence in collaborative communication. Central to Choir's ecosystem is the **Choir Token (CHOIR)**, which acts as energy quanta in a quantum harmonic oscillator system, enabling threads to evolve through temperature and frequency dynamics that naturally select for quality without artificial barriers.

## Introduction

Traditional platforms struggle with content quality and moderation, often resorting to arbitrary rules or reputation systems. Choir takes a fundamentally different approach by implementing a thermodynamic model where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics and phase transitions.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name**: Choir Token
- **Token Symbol**: CHOIR
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) tokens (Fixed Energy Quantum)
- **Token Standard**: Solana Program Library (SPL) Token
- **Initial Allocation**: All tokens minted to Choir Treasury (Initial Energy Reserve)

## Token Flow Mechanics

### 1. Core Token Flows
- **Rejections:** Stake flows to thread, increasing its energy and temperature
- **Split Decisions:** Approvers' stake flows to Treasury, funding citation rewards
- **Approvals:** Stake distributes directly to approvers
- **Treasury:** Acts as energy reservoir for perpetual citation rewards

### 2. Reward Structure
- **New Message Rewards:**
  * High initial distribution
  * Logarithmic decay over 4 years
  * 50% distributed in first year
  * 99% distributed by year 4

- **Citation Rewards:**
  * Funded by Treasury from split decisions
  * Perpetual availability
  * Encourages content linking
  * Promotes knowledge network growth

## Thermodynamic Mechanics

### 1. Thread Energy States

Each thread exists as a quantum harmonic oscillator characterized by:
- Temperature (T) - measures chaos/volatility
- Frequency (ω) - measures organization/coherence
- Energy (E) - total thread energy
- Co-authors (N) - system size

### 2. Energy Dynamics

**Stake Requirements**
- Calculated using quantum harmonic oscillator formula:
  ```
  stake = base_stake * (0.5 + 1/[exp(ℏω/kT) - 1])
  ```
- Higher temperature (T) increases stakes
- Higher frequency (ω) moderates stakes
- Creates natural quality selection

**State Transitions**
- Rejection: Increases thread temperature
  * Stake energy flows into thread
  * Temperature rises (E/N increases)
  * Frequency unchanged

- Split Decision: Hybrid energy flow
  * Approvers' stake flows to Treasury
  * Maintains circular token flow
  * Enables perpetual rewards
  * Temperature unchanged

- Approval: Moderates temperature
  * Energy distributes to approvers
  * Temperature decreases (new co-author)
  * Frequency increases

### 3. Natural Evolution

**Thread Maturation**
- Young threads start hot (high T)
- Natural cooling over time
- Quality barriers emerge organically
- Communities crystallize naturally

**Quality Emergence**
- Hot threads: Expensive but potentially valuable
- Cool threads: Accessible and stable
- High frequency: Well-organized and efficient
- Natural selection for coherence

## Treasury Dynamics

### 1. Energy Reservoir
- Accumulates tokens from split decisions
- Maintains perpetual citation rewards
- Creates circular token flow
- Ensures system sustainability

### 2. Reward Distribution
- New message rewards follow logarithmic decay
- Citation rewards scale with Treasury balance
- System maintains token velocity
- Natural incentive alignment

## Economic Implications

### 1. Value Discovery
- Quality emerges from energy dynamics
- No artificial reputation systems
- Natural price discovery through T and ω
- Self-organizing quality standards

### 2. Participation Incentives
- Pattern recognition rewarded
- Early participation in high-potential threads
- Contribution to frequency alignment
- Natural selection for value creation

### 3. Community Evolution
- Diverse thread ecosystems emerge
- Different temperature/frequency niches
- Natural progression paths
- Self-organizing standards

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Message Submission
- User stakes CHOIR tokens (energy quanta)
- Stake requirement based on T and ω
- Energy locked until state transition
- Natural barrier against noise

### 2. Approval Process
- Co-authors evaluate within 7 days
- Unanimous approval required
- Split decisions feed Treasury
- Rejections heat up threads

### 3. Energy Distribution
- Approved: Energy distributes to approvers
- Rejected: Energy increases thread temperature
- Split decisions: Energy flows to Treasury
- Citations: Perpetual rewards from Treasury

## Future Considerations

### 1. Advanced Thermodynamics
- Multi-thread energy coupling
- Complex phase transitions
- Quantum coherence effects
- Resonance amplification

### 2. Governance Evolution
- Temperature parameter adjustment
- Energy conservation rules
- Phase transition controls
- System-wide thermodynamics

## Conclusion

Choir's thermodynamic token model creates a self-organizing system where quality emerges naturally through energy dynamics rather than arbitrary rules. By treating threads as quantum harmonic oscillators and maintaining circular token flow through the Treasury, we enable natural selection for quality while ensuring sustainable incentives for valuable contributions.

The result is a platform where:
- Quality emerges from natural laws
- Value aligns with coherence
- Communities self-organize
- Evolution is organic and sustainable
- Incentives remain perpetually aligned

This innovative model sets a new standard for decentralized platforms, demonstrating how physical principles can create robust socioeconomic systems with sustainable token economics.
