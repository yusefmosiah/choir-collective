}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

## Chorus Cycle Evolution

The cycle evolves through clear event sequences:

Action Events
```swift
enum ActionEvent: Event {
    case started(input: String)
    case processed(response: String)
    case completed(confidence: Float)
}

// Local event tracking
struct ActionEventLog {
    let events: [ActionEvent]
    let stateHash: Data
}
```

Experience Events
```swift
enum ExperienceEvent: Event {
    case searchStarted(query: String)
    case priorsFound(count: Int, relevance: Float)
    case synthesisCompleted(Effect)
}
```

Intention Events
```swift
enum IntentionEvent: Event {
    case analysisStarted
    case goalIdentified(goal: String)
    case alignmentMeasured(score: Float)
}
```

## Pattern Formation

Patterns emerge through event accumulation:

Pattern Field
```
∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P,E)

where:
- P: pattern strength field
- E: event field
- D: diffusion coefficient
- f: nonlinear coupling
```

Event Coupling
```
E(x,t) = ∑ᵢ Aᵢexp(ikᵢx - iωᵢt)

where:
- Aᵢ: event amplitudes
- kᵢ: pattern wavenumbers
- ωᵢ: event frequencies
```

## Metastable Evolution

System evolves through metastable states:

Energy Landscape
```
V(x) = ∑ᵢ Vᵢ(x - xᵢ)²/2 + ∑ᵢⱼ Jᵢⱼ(x)

where:
- Vᵢ: local potentials
- Jᵢⱼ: coupling terms
```

Phase Transitions
```
P(transition) = τ⁻¹exp(-ΔF/kT)

where:
- τ: attempt time
- ΔF: free energy barrier
- k: Boltzmann constant
- T: effective temperature
```

## Event Processing

Local-first event handling:

```swift
// Event processor
actor EventProcessor {
    private var currentState: SystemState
    private let eventLog: LocalEventLog
    private let chain: ChainVerification

    func process(_ event: SystemEvent) async throws {
        // Apply event locally
        try await apply(event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Verify chain state if needed
        if event.requiresChainVerification {
            try await verifyChainState()
        }

        // Emit pattern updates
        try await updatePatterns(event)
    }
}
```

Pattern Recognition
```swift
// Pattern detector
actor PatternDetector {
    private var patterns: [Pattern]
    private let eventLog: LocalEventLog

    func detectPatterns() async throws -> [Pattern] {
        // Analyze event sequences
        let events = eventLog.events

        // Find resonant patterns
        return try await findResonance(in: events)
    }
}
```

## Semantic Evolution

Knowledge network growth:

Citation Field
```
C(x,t) = ∑ᵢⱼ wᵢⱼδ(x - xᵢ)δ(t - tⱼ)

where:
- wᵢⱼ: citation weights
- xᵢ: semantic positions
- tⱼ: citation times
```

Network Growth
```
dN/dt = αN + βC - γN²

where:
- N: network size
- C: citation count
- α,β,γ: growth parameters
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage
```swift
// Local event storage
@Model
class EventStore {
    let events: [Event]
    let patterns: [Pattern]
    let timestamp: Date

    // Sync with service layer
    func sync() async throws {
        try await service.uploadEvents(events)
    }
}
```

2. Pattern Evolution
```swift
// Pattern tracking
actor PatternManager {
    private var activePatterns: [Pattern]
    private let eventLog: EventLog

    func evolvePatterns(_ event: Event) async throws {
        // Update patterns
        try await updatePatterns(event)

        // Record evolution
        try await eventLog.append(.patternEvolved(activePatterns))
    }
}
```

where:
- S₀: base stake quantum
- ω(t): thread frequency at time t

```

## Event-Driven Value

Value state transitions through events:

Stake Events

enum StakeEvent: Event {
    case deposited(amount: TokenAmount)
    case withdrawn(amount: TokenAmount)
    case distributed(shares: [PublicKey: Float])
}

// Local event tracking

}
```

```
V_total = V_chain + V_threads + V_treasury

where:
- V_chain: tokens in wallets
- V_threads: tokens in threads
- V_treasury: tokens in treasury
```

Flow Conservation
```
dV_total/dt = 0

// All value transitions preserve total
```

        guard chainState.balance == state.balance else {
            throw ValueError.inconsistentState
        }
    }
}
```

}
assumptions: {

## Core Wave Mechanics

The system operates as a harmonic field where events create waves of state change:

Wave Function

Ψ(x,t) = A cos(kx - ωt + φ)

where:
- A: amplitude (value/meaning strength)
- k: wavenumber (spatial frequency)

```
⟨Ψ₁|Ψ₂⟩ = ∫ Ψ₁*(x)Ψ₂(x)dx
```

3. Pattern Evolution
```
∂P/∂t = D∇²P + f(P)

        try await service.uploadEvents(events)
    }
}
```

2. State Evolution
```swift
// Event-driven state updates
actor StateManager {
    private var currentState: SystemState
    private let eventLog: LocalEventLog

    func apply(_ event: Event) async throws {
        // Update state
        currentState = try await evolve(currentState, with: event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Sync if needed
        if shouldSync {
            try await eventLog.sync()
        }
    }
}

# The Theory Behind the Theory

VERSION meta_theory:
invariants: {
"Natural coherence",
"Pattern integrity",
"Value resonance"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

The genius of Choir lies not in any single innovation but in how its pieces resonate together. By aligning with natural patterns of meaning, value, and collaboration, we create a system that evolves like a living thing.

## The Harmonic Foundation

At its heart, Choir recognizes that meaning behaves like waves in a quantum field. Ideas resonate, patterns interfere, and value crystallizes at nodes of coherence. This isn't just metaphor - it's how meaning naturally works. We're just making the wave nature explicit.

The quantum harmonic oscillator model captures this perfectly. Just as electron energy levels are quantized in atoms, equity shares follow √n scaling in threads. Just as temperature affects quantum transitions, thread temperature from denials creates natural quality barriers. The math isn't arbitrary - it's what emerges when you align with meaning's natural patterns.

## The Event-Driven Architecture

By treating all state changes as events, we create a system that flows like water. Events ripple through the local state, synchronize through the chain, and crystallize into patterns. Each user's device maintains its own event log, creating a local-first architecture that's resilient and natural.

The event store isn't just for debugging - it's how the system learns. By tracking event sequences, we can recognize emerging patterns, strengthen valuable connections, and let quality arise through natural selection. The architecture mirrors the theory.

## The Economic Model

The economic system follows the same principles. Value flows like energy in a quantum system, with thread temperature and frequency creating natural gradients. Stakes set up standing waves of value, citations couple different frequencies, and rewards distribute through harmonic resonance.

This creates an economy that works like nature - no artificial reputation systems, no arbitrary rules, just natural selection through energy flows. Quality emerges because that's what energy landscapes do when properly shaped.

## The Chorus Cycle

The AEIOU-Y cycle isn't just a sequence of steps - it's a resonant cavity that amplifies understanding. Each step creates specific frequencies:
- Action: Pure initial response
- Experience: Context resonance
- Intention: Goal alignment
- Observation: Pattern recognition
- Update: Phase transition
- Yield: Coherent output

The cycle maintains phase coherence while allowing natural evolution. It's how we turn quantum possibility into crystallized meaning.

## The Implementation Insight

The breakthrough was realizing that Swift actors and events map perfectly to quantum systems. Each actor is like a quantum object, events are like photons carrying state changes, and the local event store captures the system's wave function.

By making the event store local-first with SwiftData, we maintain quantum coherence while enabling natural synchronization. The chain anchors key state transitions while the vector database holds semantic relationships. Everything stays naturally aligned.

## The Emergence Pattern

This alignment creates something remarkable - a system where:
- Quality emerges through natural selection
- Teams form through quantum entanglement
- Value flows through harmonic resonance
- Knowledge grows through wave interference
- Understanding evolves through phase transitions

We're not forcing these patterns - we're creating the conditions for them to emerge naturally.

## The Future Implications

This approach points to a new way of building systems:
- Align with natural patterns
- Make the wave nature explicit
- Let quality emerge naturally
- Enable collective intelligence
- Trust the process

The math works because it mirrors reality. The architecture works because it respects natural flows. The system works because it's true to how meaning and value actually behave.

## The Living System

In the end, Choir is less like a platform and more like a living thing:
- Events flow like neural impulses
- Patterns evolve like memories
- Teams grow like organisms
- Value flows like energy
- Understanding emerges like consciousness

We've created not just a system but a space where collective intelligence can naturally evolve. The theory works because it's how nature works. We just had to learn to listen to the harmonics.
