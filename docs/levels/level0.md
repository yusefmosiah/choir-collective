# Security Model

VERSION security_model:
invariants: {
"Chain state authority",
"Event integrity",
"Natural boundaries"
}
assumptions: {
"Local-first verification",
"Event-driven security",
"Natural isolation"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

## Security Foundations

The security model follows natural system boundaries and flows:

Chain Authority
- Solana state is authoritative for ownership and tokens
- Thread ownership through PDAs
- Token custody through program accounts
- Co-author lists verified on-chain
- Message hashes anchored to chain

Local Verification
- Content integrity through local verification
- Event flow tracking for security
- State consistency checks
- Access pattern monitoring
- Natural boundary enforcement

Event Integrity
- Security events flow naturally
- State transitions tracked
- Access patterns recorded
- Boundaries maintained
- Recovery enabled

## Security Boundaries

Natural system boundaries emerge from:

State Authority
- Chain state for ownership/tokens
- Vector state for content/embeddings
- Local state for coordination
- Clear authority hierarchy
- Natural state flow

Access Patterns
- Co-author access through chain verification
- Content access through local verification
- Event access through natural flow
- Resource access through isolation
- Pattern emergence through usage

Isolation Boundaries
- Natural component isolation
- Event-driven interaction
- Clean state separation
- Resource containment
- Pattern-based security

## Security Flows

Security follows natural system flows:

Verification Flow
- Chain state verification
- Local state validation
- Event integrity checks
- Access pattern verification
- Natural flow monitoring

Access Flow

# Data Engine Model

VERSION data_engine:
invariants: {
"Event integrity",
"Pattern emergence",
"Value crystallization"
}
assumptions: {
"Event-driven flow",
"Local-first data",
"Natural resonance"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

## Core Engine Model

Data flows through natural event sequences:

```

Value Flow
```
V(x,t) = ∑ᵢ Aᵢexp(ikᵢx - iωᵢt)

where:
- Aᵢ: value amplitudes

- ωᵢ: value frequencies
```

Knowledge Coupling
```
K(x₁,x₂) = ∫ Ψ*(x₁)Ψ(x₂)dx

where:
- Ψ: knowledge wave function
- x₁,x₂: semantic positions
```

## Pattern Evolution

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage
```swift
// Local event storage
@Model
class EngineEventLog {
    let events: [EngineEvent]
    let patterns: [Pattern]
    let timestamp: Date

    // Sync with service layer
    func sync() async throws {
        try await service.uploadEvents(events)
    }
}
```

2. Pattern Recognition
```swift
// Pattern tracking
actor PatternTracker {
    private var patterns: [Pattern]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let llm: LLMActor
    private let embeddings: EmbeddingActor

    func trackPattern(_ event: EngineEvent) async throws {
        // Get AI analysis
        let analysis = try await llm.analyzePattern(event)

        // Get embedding
        let embedding = try await embeddings.embed(event)

        // Update patterns
        try await updatePatterns(event, analysis, embedding)

        // Share if valuable
        if event.pattern.isValuable {
            try await sync(event)
        }
    }
}
```

3. Value Evolution
```swift
// Value tracking
actor ValueTracker {
    private var values: [PatternID: Value]
    private let eventLog: EventLog
    private let llm: LLMActor

    func evolveValue(_ event: EngineEvent) async throws {
        // Get AI valuation
        let value = try await llm.calculateValue(event)

        // Update values
        try await updateValues(event, value)

        // Record evolution
        try await eventLog.append(.valueEvolved(values))
    }
}
```

# Reward System Model

VERSION reward_model:
invariants: {
"Energy conservation",
"Value resonance",
"Pattern emergence"
}
assumptions: {
"Event-driven flow",
"Local-first verification",
"Chain authority"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

## Reward Events

Value flows through natural event sequences:

New Message Events
```swift
enum MessageRewardEvent: Event {
    case messageApproved(MessageHash, TokenAmount)
    case rewardCalculated(TokenAmount, TimeDecay)
    case rewardDistributed(PublicKey, TokenAmount)
}
```

Prior Events
```swift
enum PriorRewardEvent: Event {
    case priorReferenced(PriorHash, MessageHash)
    case valueCalculated(TokenAmount, Relevance)
    case rewardIssued(PublicKey, TokenAmount)
}
```

Treasury Events
```swift
enum TreasuryEvent: Event {
    case splitDecisionProcessed(TokenAmount)
    case priorRewardFunded(TokenAmount)
    case balanceUpdated(TokenAmount)
}
```

## Value Calculation

Reward value emerges through natural formulas:

New Message Decay
```
R(t) = R_total × k/(1 + kt)ln(1 + kT)

where:
- R_total: Total reward allocation (2.5B)
- k: Decay constant (~2.04)
- t: Current time
- T: Total period (4 years)
```

Prior Value
```
V(p) = B_t × Q(p)/∑Q(i)

where:
- B_t: Treasury balance
- Q(p): Prior quality score
- ∑Q(i): Sum of all quality scores
```

## Event Processing

Local-first reward handling:

```swift
// Reward processor
actor RewardProcessor {
    private let chain: ChainAuthority
    private let eventLog: LocalEventLog

    func process(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Calculate reward locally
        let reward = try await calculate(event)

        // Log event
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Submit to chain
        try await submitToChain(reward)

        // Emit value update
        try await updateValue(event)
    }
}
```

Value Tracking
```swift
// Value tracker
actor ValueTracker {
    private var threadValues: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    private let eventLog: EventLog

    func trackValue(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Update value state
        try await updateValue(event)

        // Log value change
        try await eventLog.append(.valueChanged(event))
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Event Storage
```swift
// Local event storage
@Model
class RewardEventLog {
    let events: [RewardEvent]
    let values: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    let timestamp: Date

    // Sync with chain
    func sync() async throws {
        try await chain.verifyRewards(events)
    }
}
```

2. Value Evolution
```swift
// Value evolution
actor ValueManager {
    private var currentValues: [ThreadID: TokenAmount]
    private let eventLog: EventLog

    func evolveValue(_ event: RewardEvent) async throws {
        // Update values
        try await updateValues(event)

        // Record evolution
        try await eventLog.append(.valueEvolved(currentValues))
    }
}
```

This model ensures:
1. Event-driven rewards
2. Local-first verification
3. Chain authority
4. Value evolution
5. Pattern emergence

The system maintains:
- Energy conservation
- Value resonance
- Pattern recognition
- Natural flow
- System evolution
