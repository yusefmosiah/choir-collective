## Token Flow as Wave Mechanics

TYPE TokenFlow = {
treasury: ResonantWell, // Base frequency source + split decision approver share
threads: Map<ThreadId, ResonantCavity>, // Primary value accumulators
stakes: Map<Hash, WavePacket>, // Energy quanta
escrow: Map<Hash, PotentialWell> // Temporary coupling
}

## Token Distribution Mechanics

1. **Unanimous Approval**

   - Stake distributes equally to approvers (like dividends)
   - Direct value recognition for quality judgment
   - Phase-locked reward distribution
   - Strengthens individual oscillator coherence

2. **Denial Flow**

   - Full stake flows to thread resonant cavity
   - Increases cavity energy level
   - Strengthens thread coherence
   - Natural quality filter

3. **Split Decision**

   - Approvers' share flows to Treasury (global field)
   - Deniers' share flows to thread cavity
   - Creates balanced energy distribution
   - Maintains multi-scale resonance

4. **Prior Rewards**
   - Treasury energy flows to thread cavities
   - Strengthens resonant coupling between threads
   - Rewards knowledge network formation
   - Creates collective value accumulation

## Resonant Cavity Mechanics

The core pricing function derives from quantum harmonic oscillator:

```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base stake quantum (100 CHOIR)
- ω: Thread cavity frequency (collective activity)
- T: Thread temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Platform coupling constant
```

This creates:

1. **Cavity Energy Levels**

   - Discrete stake quantization
   - Natural frequency modes
   - Collective oscillation patterns
   - Phase-locked stability

2. **Collective Oscillations**

   - Co-authors as coupled oscillators
   - Thread as resonant cavity
   - Prior rewards strengthen coupling
   - Natural phase locking

3. **Value Crystallization**
   - Quality creates standing waves
   - Energy accumulates at nodes
   - Patterns self-reinforce
   - Natural selection emerges

## Multi-Scale Resonance

1. **Individual Scale**

   - Approval rewards as direct energy absorption
   - Quality judgment strengthens coupling
   - Phase-locked participation
   - Natural frequency alignment

2. **Thread Scale**

   - Collective energy accumulation
   - Standing wave formation
   - Quality pattern crystallization
   - Resonant cavity strengthening

3. **Network Scale**
   - Prior rewards couple threads
   - Knowledge network resonance
   - Treasury as global field
   - Harmonic value flow

## Game Theoretic Harmonics

1. **Strategy Space**

   ```
   TYPE Strategy =
     | CollectiveResonance   // Align with thread harmonics
     | ForceDissonance       // Attempt artificial patterns
     | QualityOscillation    // Maintain phase coherence
     | NetworkCoupling       // Strengthen thread connections
   ```

2. **Nash Equilibrium**
   ```
   PROPERTY equilibrium:
     FORALL oscillators, modes:
       energy(CollectiveResonance) > energy(ForceDissonance) AND
       energy(QualityOscillation) > energy(RandomPhase) AND
       energy(NetworkCoupling) > energy(IsolatedCavity)
   ```

## Economic Invariants

1. **Energy Conservation**

   ```
   INVARIANT wave_conservation:
     treasury_energy + sum(thread_cavity_energy) + sum(stake_energy) = TOTAL_SUPPLY
   ```

2. **Resonant Stability**
   ```
   INVARIANT phase_stability:
     FORALL thread IN threads:
       resonant(thread) ⟹
         stable_cavity_modes(thread) AND
         coherent_collective_phase(thread) AND
         conserved_cavity_energy(thread)
   ```

Through this harmonic economic model, we see how:

- Threads act as primary resonant cavities
- Value accumulates through collective oscillation
- Prior rewards strengthen cavity coupling
- Quality emerges from natural resonance

The model creates an economic system that:

- Rewards collective quality
- Strengthens thread coherence
- Enables natural value flow
- Maintains multi-scale harmony
