## Quantum Value Model

Value flows through the system following quantum harmonic principles:

Base Price Evolution
```
P₀(t) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω(t)/kT(t))-1)]

where:
- S₀: base stake quantum
- ω(t): thread frequency at time t
- T(t): thread temperature at time t
- ℏ: reduced Planck constant
```

Equity Distribution
```
E(s,N) = (1/N) * √(s/P₀)

where:
- s: stake amount (any positive value)
- N: co-author count
- P₀: current base price
```

## Thermodynamic Flow

Temperature evolution through events:

Thread Temperature
```
T(E,N) = E/N

where:
- E: thread energy from events
- N: co-author count
```

Energy Flow
```
dE/dt = ∑ᵢ δ(t-tᵢ)eᵢ - γE

where:
- eᵢ: energy from event i
- tᵢ: event timestamp
- γ: natural cooling rate
```

## Event-Driven Value

Value state transitions through events:

Stake Events
```swift
enum StakeEvent: Event {
    case deposited(amount: TokenAmount)
    case withdrawn(amount: TokenAmount)
    case distributed(shares: [PublicKey: Float])
}

// Local event tracking
struct StakeEventLog {
    let events: [StakeEvent]
    let stateHash: Data  // For chain verification
}
```

Temperature Events
```swift
enum TempEvent: Event {
    case increased(delta: Float)
    case decreased(delta: Float)
    case equilibrated(temp: Float)
}
```

## Value Conservation

System-wide value conservation:

Total Value
```
V_total = V_chain + V_threads + V_treasury

where:
- V_chain: tokens in wallets
- V_threads: tokens in threads
- V_treasury: tokens in treasury
```

Flow Conservation
```
dV_total/dt = 0

// All value transitions preserve total
```

## Metastable States

Value crystallizes in metastable states:

Energy Barriers
```
ΔE = kT * ln(ω_high/ω_low)

where:
- ΔE: barrier height
- k: Boltzmann constant
- ω_high/ω_low: frequency ratio
```

State Transitions
```
P(transition) = A * exp(-ΔE/kT)

where:
- A: attempt frequency
- ΔE: barrier height
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Value Tracking
```swift
// Local value state
@Model
class ValueState {
    let threadId: ThreadID
    let balance: TokenAmount
    let temperature: Float
    let frequency: Float

    // Event log
    let events: [ValueEvent]
}
```

2. Chain Verification
```swift
actor ValueVerification {
    // Verify against chain state
    func verify(_ state: ValueState) async throws {
        let chainState = try await chain.getThreadState(state.threadId)

        guard chainState.balance == state.balance else {
            throw ValueError.inconsistentState
        }
    }
}
```

3. Event Processing
```swift
actor ValueProcessor {
    private var currentState: ValueState
    private let eventLog: EventLog

    func process(_ event: ValueEvent) async throws {
        // Apply event
        try await apply(event)

        // Log locally
        try await eventLog.append(event)

        // Verify with chain
        try await verify(currentState)
    }
}
```

This model ensures:
1. Value conservation
2. Event integrity
3. Chain verification
4. Local tracking
5. Pattern stability

The system maintains:
- Value coherence
- Event-driven flow
- Local-first operation
- Chain authority
- Natural evolution
