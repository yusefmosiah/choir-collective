## Development Phases

Natural system evolution through clear phases:

Foundation Phase
- Core event system
- Actor isolation
- Local storage
- Chain integration
- Basic UI

The foundation establishes:
- Event-driven patterns
- Actor boundaries
- State authority
- Resource management
- Testing patterns

Knowledge Phase
- Vector storage
- Prior system
- Citation network
- Semantic links
- Pattern recognition

The knowledge layer enables:
- Content organization
- Natural citations
- Link formation
- Pattern emergence
- Network growth

Economic Phase
- Token integration
- Temperature evolution
- Equity distribution
- Value flow
- Pattern rewards

The economic layer creates:
- Natural incentives
- Value recognition
- Team formation
- Pattern strengthening
- Network effects
