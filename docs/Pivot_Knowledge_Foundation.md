# Knowledge Foundation Strategy

## Documentation as Onboarding

```swift
struct KnowledgeBase {
    // Core understanding
    let foundations = [
        "System architecture",     // How pieces fit
        "Technical decisions",     // Why choices made
        "Evolution strategy",      // Where we're going
        "Implementation paths",    // How to get there
        "Vision alignment"         // What matters
    ]

    // Expert entry points
    let specialistDocs = [
        "ML/AI": [
            "ImageBind integration",
            "Multimodal embeddings",
            "Voice processing",
            "Quality metrics"
        ],

        "Infrastructure": [
            "LanceDB architecture",
            "P2P protocols",
            "Edge computing",
            "State sync"
        ],

        "iOS": [
            "SwiftUI patterns",
            "Concurrency model",
            "Local-first data",
            "Audio handling"
        ]
    ]
}
```

## Documentation Strategy

```swift
struct DocStrategy {
    // Progressive detail
    let layers = [
        "Vision": "High-level goals and strategy",
        "Architecture": "System design and patterns",
        "Implementation": "Technical specifics",
        "Evolution": "Future directions"
    ]

    // Expert acceleration
    let benefits = [
        "Quick onboarding",       // Fast team integration
        "Clear direction",        // Aligned development
        "Technical context",      // Why decisions made
        "Future roadmap",         // Where we're going
        "Implementation guide"    // How to build it
    ]
}
```

## Team Amplification

```swift
struct TeamAmplification {
    // Knowledge transfer
    let transfer = [
        "Vision → Direction",     // Goals inform choices
        "Patterns → Code",        // Designs become real
        "Docs → Speed",          // Understanding = velocity
        "Context → Quality"       // Why = better how
    ]

    // Collaboration enablers
    let enablers = [
        "Shared context",         // Everyone aligned
        "Clear patterns",         // How to build
        "Known tradeoffs",        // Why decisions
        "Future vision"           // Where headed
    ]
}
```

## Success Patterns

```swift
struct SuccessPatterns {
    // Documentation wins
    let outcomes = [
        "Faster onboarding",      // Team grows faster
        "Better decisions",       // Context enables quality
        "Aligned development",    // Everyone builds right
        "Preserved knowledge",    // Nothing lost
        "Future readiness"        // Path is clear
    ]

    // Team velocity
    let velocity = [
        "Clear direction",        // Know where to go
        "Proven patterns",        // Know how to build
        "Shared context",         // Know why choices
        "Future vision"          // Know what's next
    ]
}
```

This foundation:

1. Accelerates expert onboarding
2. Preserves key decisions
3. Aligns development
4. Enables scaling
5. Maintains vision
