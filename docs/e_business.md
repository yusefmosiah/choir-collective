# Choir Business Model

Choir's business model aligns with its natural principles - value flows efficiently, quality emerges organically, and growth happens sustainably. Rather than extracting value through advertising or data mining, we enable and strengthen natural value creation.

## Core Revenue Model

The platform operates on a simple freemium model that grows with teams:

Free Tier - The Foundation
- Thread participation and co-authorship
- Basic message submission and approval
- Thread visibility to co-authors

- Natural team formation

Premium Tier ($30/month / $200/yr) - Enhanced Flow
- Bonus rewards
- Increased resource allocation
- Priority message processing
- Advanced team analytics
- Enhanced privacy controls
- Growing yearly benefits

The key is that premium features amplify natural value creation rather than restricting basic functionality.
