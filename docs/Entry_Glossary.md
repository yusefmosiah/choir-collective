# Choir Technical Glossary

## Core Concepts

### Thread
A shared chat space where people work together. Like a group chat that builds value over time through good conversations. Technically: A collaborative context with its own token balance and message history.

### Co-author
Someone who helps guide a thread's growth by voting on new messages. Like a curator or editor. You become one when your message gets approved. Technically: A participant with approval rights in a thread.

### Spec (Speculative Response)
A message you submit to join a thread's co-authors. Like applying to join a team with a work sample. Requires staking tokens to show you're serious. Technically: A message submission requiring stake and approval.

## Token System

### CHOIR Token
The platform's native token used for staking and rewards. Like energy that flows through the system, rewarding quality and enabling participation.

### Stake
Tokens you commit when submitting a spec. Like putting down a deposit to show you're serious about contributing quality content.

### Thread Balance
Tokens a thread has accumulated over time. Like a team's shared resources that grow through good decisions.

### Treasury
The system's reserve that funds ongoing rewards. Like a community pool that enables sustainable growth.

## Message Flow

### Approval
When all co-authors agree a message should be public. The stake gets distributed to approvers as a reward for good judgment.

### Denial
When any co-author decides a message isn't right for the thread. The stake strengthens the thread itself.

### Split Decision
When some approve and others deny. Approvers' share goes to Treasury, deniers' share to thread.

### Prior Reference
When one thread cites another, creating knowledge connections. The referenced thread earns rewards.

## Team Dynamics

### Team Formation
How people naturally gather around valuable threads, sharing in their success.

### Knowledge Network
How threads connect to each other through references, building a web of knowledge.

### Collective Value
How threads accumulate value that benefits all co-authors, encouraging collaboration.

### Quality Emergence
How good content and practices naturally arise without heavy-handed rules.

## Technical Terms (For Developers)

### PDA (Program Derived Address)
A special Solana account that holds a thread's tokens.

### State Transition
Any change in the system, like approving a message or adding a co-author.

### Content Hash
A unique fingerprint that verifies message content hasn't changed.

### WebSocket Event
Real-time updates that keep everyone's view in sync.

### State Sync
Process of keeping all parts of the system consistent.

### Optimistic Update
Showing changes in the UI before blockchain confirmation.

Through these mechanics, Choir creates a space where quality content, valuable interactions, and natural communities can emerge.
