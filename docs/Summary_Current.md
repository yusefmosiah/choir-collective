## Key Insights

1. **Quantum Equity Structure**
   ```python
   # Base price for 1/N share
   P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

   # Equity follows √n scaling
   equity = (1/N) * √(stake/P₀)

   # Examples:
   stake = P₀/4  -> equity = (1/2N)  # Quarter stake
   stake = P₀    -> equity = (1/N)   # Base quantum
   stake = 4P₀   -> equity = (2/N)   # Double quantum
   ```

2. **Semantic Structure**
   ```python
   class SemanticLink:
       """Hyperedge in thoughtspace"""
       def __init__(self, source, response, priors):
           self.nodes = [source, response, *priors]
           self.position = average_embeddings(self.nodes)
   ```

3. **Thread Thermodynamics**
   ```python
   def handle_denial(thread: Thread, stake: float):
       """Denial increases thread temperature"""
       thread.energy += stake
       thread.temperature = thread.energy / len(thread.co_authors)

   def handle_approval(thread: Thread, stake: float):
       """Distribute by equity shares"""
       for coauthor, equity in thread.equity_map.items():
           reward = stake * equity
           send_tokens(coauthor, reward)
   ```

4. **Implementation Requirements**
   - Quantum equity calculation system
   - Semantic links collection in Qdrant
   - Thread thermodynamics tracking
   - UI for showing relationships and equity

5. **Future Implications**
   - Natural price discovery through quantum mechanics
   - Semantic search through link positions
   - Value flow follows quantum principles
   - Self-organizing knowledge structure

## Next Steps

1. Implement quantum equity calculation
2. Update database schema for semantic links
3. Add thread thermodynamics tracking
4. Modify UI to show relationships and equity
5. Add tests for quantum mechanics and semantic integrity

The key realization is that both value distribution and semantic meaning follow quantum mechanical principles, creating a unified system where equity quantization and semantic links work together to enable natural evolution of knowledge and value.
