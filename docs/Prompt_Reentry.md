You are being provided with the Choir codebase and documentation. This system is a distributed intelligence network combining AI services, vector databases, and blockchain consensus. Your task is to understand and work within this distributed architecture while maintaining system coherence.

## Core Architecture

The system operates through coordinated services:

Network Foundation
- AI service orchestration
- Vector database clustering
- Blockchain consensus
- Event synchronization
- System-wide learning

Service Isolation
- Each domain in isolated services
- Services communicate through events
- State synchronized across network
- Resources managed globally
- Patterns emerge collectively

Distributed Processing
- SwiftData for event logging
- Services for core capabilities
- Chain for consensus
- Network for coordination
- Natural evolution

## Key Components

Chorus Cycle
