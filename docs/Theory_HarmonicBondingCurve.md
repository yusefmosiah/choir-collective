## Dual Wave Functions

The system operates through two interrelated wave functions:

1. **Value Wave Function**
```python
def calculate_equity(stake: float, base_price: float, N: int) -> float:
    """Quantum harmonic oscillator for value distribution.

    stake: Any positive amount
    base_price: P₀ from oscillator equation
    N: Current number of co-authors
    """
    n = stake / base_price  # Quantum number
    return (1/N) * math.sqrt(n)  # √n scaling
```

2. **Meaning Wave Function**
```python
def calculate_semantic_position(nodes: List[Vector]) -> Vector:
    """Average position in thoughtspace for semantic link.

    nodes: [user_message, ai_response, *cited_priors]
    """
    return average_embeddings(nodes)  # Simple arithmetic mean
```

## Quantum Harmonic Properties

1. **Value Quantization**
```python
# Base price for one quantum (1/N share)
P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

# Examples of stake scaling:
stake = P₀/4  -> equity = (1/2N)  # Quarter quantum
stake = P₀    -> equity = (1/N)   # Full quantum
stake = 4P₀   -> equity = (2/N)   # Double quantum
```

2. **Semantic Entanglement**
```python
class SemanticLink:
    """Hyperedge in thoughtspace connecting:
    - User message
    - AI response
    - Cited priors
    """
    def __init__(self,
                 user_message: Vector,
                 ai_response: Vector,
                 cited_priors: List[Vector]):
        self.nodes = [user_message, ai_response, *cited_priors]
        self.position = average_embeddings(self.nodes)
```

## Wave Function Evolution

1. **Value Evolution**
```python
def handle_approval(thread: Thread, stake: float):
    """Distribute stake by equity shares."""
    for coauthor, equity in thread.equity_map.items():
        reward = stake * equity
        send_tokens(coauthor, reward)

def handle_denial(thread: Thread, stake: float):
    """Increase thread temperature."""
    thread.energy += stake
    thread.temperature = thread.energy / len(thread.co_authors)
```

2. **Meaning Evolution**
```python
def record_semantic_link(
    user_message: Message,
    ai_response: Message,
    cited_priors: List[Message]
) -> SemanticLink:
    """Record hyperedge in thoughtspace."""
    link = SemanticLink(
        user_message.vector,
        ai_response.vector,
        [p.vector for p in cited_priors]
    )
    store_in_qdrant(link)
    return link
```

## Multi-Scale Resonance

1. **Value Resonance**
- Stake amounts determine equity shares
- Equity shares determine reward distribution
- Denials increase thread temperature
- Temperature affects base price

2. **Semantic Resonance**
- Messages form semantic links
- Links have positions in thoughtspace
- Networks emerge through citations
- Knowledge topology evolves

## Implementation Notes

1. **Value Properties**
- No minimum stake requirement
- Continuous stake-to-equity curve
- Natural √n scaling from physics
- Proportional reward distribution

2. **Semantic Properties**
- Links are hyperedges
- Positions are averaged
- Networks emerge naturally
- Topology evolves coherently

Through this unified model:
- Value flows through equity shares
- Meaning flows through semantic links
- Both follow quantum principles
- Natural evolution emerges
