## Core Measurements

1. **Thread Temperature (T)**

   ```python
   # Energy from denials increases temperature
   def calculate_temperature(thread: Thread) -> float:
       """
       T = E/N where:
       E = thread energy (from denials)
       N = number of co-authors
       """
       return thread.energy / len(thread.co_authors)
   ```

2. **Thread Frequency (ω)**

   ```python
   def calculate_frequency(thread: Thread) -> float:
       """
       ω = natural frequency from activity and value
       Higher ω = higher base price P₀
       """
       activity = thread.message_rate / sqrt(len(thread.co_authors))
       value = log(1 + thread.token_balance)
       return sqrt(activity**2 + value**2)
   ```

3. **Base Price (P₀)**

   ```python
   def calculate_base_price(T: float, ω: float) -> float:
       """
       P₀ = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

       Base price for 1/N equity share
       Any positive stake amount is valid
       Equity follows √n scaling
       """
       S₀ = BASE_STAKE_QUANTUM
       h_bar = PLATFORM_COUPLING_CONSTANT
       k = BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT

       return S₀ * (0.5 + 1/(exp(h_bar * ω / (k * T)) - 1))
   ```

4. **Equity Distribution**

   ```python
   def calculate_equity(stake: float, P₀: float, N: int) -> float:
       """
       E = (1/N) * √(stake/P₀)

       stake: Any positive amount
       P₀: Base price for 1/N share
       N: Current number of co-authors
       """
       return (1/N) * sqrt(stake/P₀)
   ```

## Thermodynamic Effects

1. **Denial Flow**

   ```python
   def handle_denial(thread: Thread, stake: float):
       """Denial increases thread temperature"""
       thread.energy += stake
       thread.temperature = thread.energy / len(thread.co_authors)
       thread.token_balance += stake
   ```

2. **Approval Flow**

   ```python
   def handle_approval(thread: Thread, stake: float):
       """Distribute by equity shares"""
       for coauthor, equity in thread.equity_map.items():
           reward = stake * equity
           send_tokens(coauthor, reward)
   ```

3. **Split Decision**

   ```python
   def handle_split(thread: Thread, stake: float,
                   approvers: int, deniers: int):
       """Balance treasury and thread energy"""
       total = approvers + deniers
       denier_share = (deniers/total) * stake
       approver_share = stake - denier_share

       # Denier share to thread
       thread.energy += denier_share
       thread.token_balance += denier_share

       # Approver share to treasury
       treasury.deposit(approver_share)
   ```

## Natural Selection Through Energy

1. **Hot Threads** (High rejection rate)

   - Accumulate energy from denials
   - Higher base price P₀
   - Natural quality filter
   - Stronger resonant cavity

2. **Cool Threads** (High approval rate)
   - Direct rewards to co-authors
   - Lower barriers to entry
   - Natural collaboration space
   - Phase-locked stability

## Stake Scaling Examples

```python
# For thread with N co-authors:
examples = [
    (P₀/4,  0.5/N),  # Quarter stake -> half quantum
    (P₀,    1.0/N),  # Base stake -> full quantum
    (4*P₀,  2.0/N)   # 4x stake -> double quantum
]
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Equity Properties**

   - No minimum stake requirement
   - Continuous stake-to-equity curve
   - Natural √n scaling from physics
   - Proportional reward distribution

2. **Temperature Effects**

   - Denials increase thread temperature
   - Higher temperature raises base price
   - Creates natural quality barrier
   - Maintains thread coherence

3. **Frequency Evolution**
   - Activity increases frequency
   - Higher frequency affects base price
   - Natural resonance patterns
   - Phase-locked stability

Through this quantum thermodynamic model, we create:

- Natural quality emergence
- Fair value distribution
- Sustainable evolution
- Coherent communities
