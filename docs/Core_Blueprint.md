# Choir Technical Blueprint

VERSION blueprint_system:
invariants: {
"State consistency",
"Value conservation",
"Security boundaries"
}
assumptions: {
"Documentation-driven development",
"AI-assisted code generation",
"Test-first implementation"
}
docs_version: "0.2.1"

## System Architecture

The system operates across four interconnected layers:

### 1. Value Layer (Solana)

- Thread ownership and token custody
- State transitions and approvals
- Token balances and stakes
- Security boundaries

### 2. Content Layer (Qdrant)

- Message storage and retrieval
- Vector embeddings for search
- Metadata management
- Access control

### 3. Coordination Layer (Backend)

- Real-time state synchronization
- WebSocket communication
- Cache management
- API endpoints

### 4. Interaction Layer (Frontend)

- Real-time chat interface
- Wallet integration
- State visualization
- User interactions

## Core Components

1. **Thread System**

   - Co-author management
   - Message approval process
   - Token balance tracking
   - State transitions

2. **Token Mechanics**

   - CHOIR token implementation
   - Stake management
   - Value distribution:
     - Approval: to approvers directly
     - Denial: to thread balance
     - Split: approvers' share to Treasury, deniers' to thread
   - Treasury operations:
     - Accumulates from split decision approver shares
     - Funds perpetual citation rewards
     - Enables sustainable value flow

3. **State Management**
   - Consistency verification
   - State persistence
   - Real-time updates
   - Cache coherence

## Development Approach

1. **Documentation-Driven Development**

   - Comprehensive specifications
   - Test generation from docs
   - AI-assisted implementation
   - High doc-to-code ratio

2. **Test-First Development**

   - Fuzzing-driven program design
   - Property-based testing
   - Invariant verification
   - Security-first approach

3. **AI-Assisted Generation**
   - Code generation from docs
   - Test case generation
   - Pattern recognition
   - Implementation assistance

## Security Model

1. **Core Security**

   - State transition atomicity
   - Value conservation
   - Access control
   - Privacy preservation

2. **Data Security**
   - Content integrity
   - State consistency
   - Secure communication
   - Privacy controls

## Future Evolution

The system is designed to evolve with:

- Improved AI capabilities
- Enhanced testing tools
- Automated code generation
- Scaled development patterns

Through this architecture, Choir creates a foundation for collaborative content creation where quality and value can emerge naturally through user interactions and collective judgment.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Core Testing**
   - Property-based testing
   - State transition verification
   - Security invariant checks
   - Integration testing

2. **Security Focus**
   - Attack surface analysis
   - Access control verification
   - Value conservation checks
   - State consistency validation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Throughput benchmarks
   - Latency measurements
   - Resource utilization
   - Scalability verification
