docs_version: "0.2.2"

## Three Systems of Value

### Web2 Hierarchy (2004-2024)
```
Power Structure:
1. Centralized control
2. Top-down value extraction
3. Algorithmic manipulation
4. Data harvesting
5. User commodification

Works because:
- Clear command & control
- Efficient value extraction
- Predictable revenue
- Scale economics
- Network effects
```

### Web3 Cycles (2009-2024)
```
Minsky Cycle Pattern:
1. Hedged Finance (Bitcoin, early Ethereum)
   - Real innovation
   - Genuine believers
   - Sustainable growth

2. Speculative Finance (ICOs, DeFi Summer)
   - Leverage increases
   - Success breeds imitation
   - Risk tolerance grows

3. Ponzi Finance (NFTs, Memecoins)
   - Pure speculation
   - Greater fool theory
   - Pyramid dynamics

4. Bust (Repeated)
   - Leverage collapse
   - Trust destruction
   - Value evaporation

5. Return to Hedge
   - Core believers remain
   - Real development continues
   - Next cycle seeds plant
```

Characteristics:
- Circular evolution
- Expensive iteration
- Slow improvement
- Gradual disruption
- Ideological extremes

### Chorus Harmony (2024+)
```
Resonance Pattern:
1. Natural oscillation
2. Quality emergence
3. Value crystallization
4. Pattern recognition
5. Sustainable evolution

Works through:
- Physics not ideology
- Quality not quantity
- Resonance not force
- Evolution not revolution
```

## System Dynamics

### Web2 Power Law
- Winner takes all
- Data accumulation
- Network effects
- Scale advantages
- Monopoly tendency

### Web3 Boom-Bust
- Ideological extremes
- Market psychology
- Leverage cycles
- Trust destruction
- Phoenix rebirth

### Chorus Wave Function
- Natural frequency
- Quality resonance
- Value preservation
- Pattern emergence
- Sustainable growth

## Value Creation Models

### Web2 Extraction
- User data mining
- Engagement optimization
- Behavioral manipulation
- Privacy erosion
- Attention harvesting

### Web3 Speculation
```
Cycle-Dependent:
Hedge Phase:
- Technical innovation
- Infrastructure building
- Community formation

Speculative Phase:
- Leverage expansion
- Narrative proliferation
- FOMO acceleration

Ponzi Phase:
- Pure gambling
- Pyramid schemes
- Exit scams
```

### Chorus Evolution
- Quality emergence
- Natural selection
- Pattern recognition
- Value crystallization
- Harmonic growth

## Historical Context

### Web2 Evolution
```
1. Search (Google)
2. Social (Facebook)
3. Mobile (Apple)
4. Cloud (Amazon)
5. AI (Current)
Each wave increases centralization
```

### Web3 Cycles
```
1. Bitcoin (Digital Gold)
2. Ethereum (Smart Contracts)
3. ICOs (Token Revolution)
4. DeFi (Financial Reform)
5. NFTs (Digital Property)
6. Memecoins (Pure Speculation)
Each cycle faster, more extreme
```

### Chorus Potential
```
1. Quality Emergence
2. Value Preservation
3. Pattern Recognition
4. Community Evolution
5. Sustainable Growth
Each phase builds on previous
```

## Future Implications

### Web2 Trajectory
- More surveillance
- Less privacy
- Greater control
- Deeper manipulation
- Total commodification

### Web3 Cycles
- Faster cycles
- Greater extremes
- Quicker busts
- Deeper ideology
- Gradual improvement

### Chorus Evolution
- Natural selection
- Quality emergence
- Value preservation
- Pattern harmony
- Sustainable growth

The key insight is that Web2 works through hierarchical force, Web3 works through boom-bust cycles of creative destruction, while Chorus works through natural harmonic evolution. Each represents a different approach to value creation and distribution - forced, cyclic, and emergent respectively.

This isn't just about technology - it's about fundamentally different ways of organizing human collaboration and value creation. Web2 forces it, Web3 cycles through it, Chorus lets it emerge naturally.
