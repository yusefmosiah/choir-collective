docs_version: "0.4.0"

## Security Foundations

The security model follows natural system boundaries and flows:

Chain Authority

- Solana state is authoritative for ownership and tokens
- Thread ownership through PDAs
- Token custody through program accounts
- Co-author lists verified on-chain
- Message hashes anchored to chain

Local Verification

- Content integrity through local verification
- Event flow tracking for security
- State consistency checks
- Access pattern monitoring
- Natural boundary enforcement

Event Integrity

- Security events flow naturally
- State transitions tracked
- Access patterns recorded
- Boundaries maintained
- Recovery enabled

## Security Boundaries

Natural system boundaries emerge from:

State Authority

- Chain state for ownership/tokens
- Vector state for content/embeddings
- Local state for coordination
- Clear authority hierarchy
- Natural state flow

Access Patterns

- Co-author access through chain verification
- Content access through local verification
- Event access through natural flow
- Resource access through isolation
- Pattern emergence through usage

Isolation Boundaries

- Natural component isolation
- Event-driven interaction
- Clean state separation
- Resource containment
- Pattern-based security

## Security Flows

Security follows natural system flows:

Verification Flow

- Chain state verification
- Local state validation
- Event integrity checks
- Access pattern verification
- Natural flow monitoring

Access Flow

- Chain-verified ownership
- Content access rights
- Event access patterns
- Resource allocation
- Natural restrictions

Recovery Flow

- State inconsistency detection
- Event flow recovery
- Access pattern restoration
- Resource reallocation
- Natural healing

## Security Properties

The system maintains natural security properties:

State Integrity

- Chain state remains authoritative
- Local state stays consistent
- Events flow cleanly
- Patterns emerge naturally
- Boundaries hold

Access Control

- Ownership verified on-chain
- Content access controlled locally
- Events flow appropriately
- Resources properly isolated
- Patterns respected

Recovery Capability

- State recovery through events
- Access pattern restoration
- Boundary enforcement
- Resource reallocation
- Natural system healing

## Recovery Patterns

Recovery follows natural system patterns:

State Recovery

- Chain state as foundation
- Event replay for consistency
- Pattern restoration
- Boundary reestablishment
- Natural healing flow

Access Recovery

- Chain verification reset
- Access pattern restoration
- Event flow reestablishment
- Resource reallocation
- Pattern emergence

System Healing

- Natural boundary restoration
- Event flow recovery
- State consistency
- Pattern reemergence
- Flow reestablishment

This security model provides:

1. Clear authority boundaries
2. Natural state verification
3. Clean event flows
4. Pattern-based security
5. Natural recovery

The system ensures:

- Chain state authority
- Event integrity
- Natural boundaries
- Clean recovery
- Pattern emergence
