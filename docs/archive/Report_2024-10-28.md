# Choir: Harmonic Intelligence Platform

VERSION harmonic_system:
invariants: {
"Wave resonance",
"Energy conservation",
"Pattern emergence"
}
assumptions: {
"Apple ecosystem excellence",
"Swift implementation",
"Natural harmonics"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"  # Post-alignment vision, Nov 2024
# Development Report - October 28, 2023

## Today's Progress

### 1. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Jest setup for frontend
- ✅ Pytest for FastAPI backend
- ✅ Basic Anchor tests working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### 2. Attempted & Deferred
- ❌ Anchor-bankrun setup (deferred post PMF)
  - Tests take too long to run
  - Prioritizing iteration speed
- ❌ Trident fuzzing (deferred post PMF)
  - Setup complexity not worth it yet
  - Will revisit after core functionality
- ❌ Render.com env var automation
  - Manual env management for now
  - Simpler for initial development

### 3. Documentation Evolution
- ✅ "Chorus Loop" → "Chorus Cycle"
- ✅ "Citations/Sources" → "Priors"
- ✅ Enhanced mobile-first design patterns
- ✅ Unified quantum semantic terminology

## Ready for Tomorrow (Oct 29)

### 1. Development Environment
- Frontend: Next.js + Jest
- Backend: FastAPI + Pytest
- Blockchain: Anchor test
- Basic CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Core Implementation Files
- Core_Priors.md - Quantum semantic foundation
- Frontend_ChoirChat_UI.md - Mobile-first design
- Impl_ChorusCycle.md - Core cycle mechanics
- Impl_Messages.md - Message and prior flow

### 3. Tomorrow's Focus: Chorus Cycle
- Chat interface with WebSocket
- Real-time message flow
- Prior rendering
- Thread state management

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Speed Over Complexity
- Simple testing setup enables faster iteration
- Manual env management acceptable for now
- Core functionality over advanced testing
- Anchor test sufficient for initial development

### 2. Documentation Value
- Strong foundation for implementation
- Clear mobile-first patterns
- Evolved terminology aligns with vision
- High doc-to-code ratio beneficial

### 3. Technical Decisions
- Defer complex testing frameworks
- Focus on developer experience
- Prioritize iteration speed
- Keep deployment simple

## Tomorrow's Priority

Build the core chat experience with the Chorus Cycle:
1. Real-time message flow
2. Prior rendering and interaction
3. Mobile-first bottom sheet UI
4. Thread state management

## Readiness Assessment
- ✅ Development environment
- ✅ Testing infrastructure
- ✅ Documentation foundation
- ✅ Clear implementation path

The foundation is solid - we're ready to start building the core chat experience tomorrow with a focus on mobile-first design and the Chorus Cycle integration.
