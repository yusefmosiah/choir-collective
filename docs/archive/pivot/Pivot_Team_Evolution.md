# Team Evolution Strategy

## Phase 1: Vision & Foundation (Current)
```swift
struct FounderRole {
    let strengths = [
        "Product vision",        // Big picture thinking
        "Technical direction",   // Architecture planning
        "Strategy",             // Evolution path
        "Documentation",        // Knowledge capture
        "Community building"    // Early adoption
    ]

    let deliverables = [
        "Core iOS app",         // Text-first MVP
        "Basic infrastructure", // Essential services
        "Initial community",    // Early adopters
        "Documentation",        // Technical foundation
        "Funding strategy"      // Resource planning
    ]
}
```

## Phase 2: Expert Team
```swift
struct ExpertTeam {
    let specialists = [
        "ML/AI Engineer": [
            "Multimodal embeddings",
            "Voice processing",
            "Model optimization",
            "Quality metrics"
        ],

        "Infrastructure Engineer": [
            "Distributed systems",
            "Edge computing",
            "P2P protocols",
            "Performance"
        ],

        "iOS Developer": [
            "SwiftUI mastery",
            "Local-first data",
            "Audio handling",
            "Edge ML"
        ]
    ]
}
```

## Role Evolution
```swift
struct RoleTransition {
    let phase1 = "Vision, Direction, Strategy"
    let phase2 = "Product, Community, Growth"

    let evolution = [
        "From": [
            "Hands-on development",
            "Direct implementation",
            "Technical decisions"
        ],
        "To": [
            "Team building",
            "Vision maintenance",
            "Strategic direction"
        ]
    ]
}
```

This approach:
1. Leverages your strengths now
2. Builds essential foundation
3. Identifies key hires
4. Maintains vision
5. Enables scaling
