## Mission

To create a communication platform where quality emerges naturally through physical principles rather than arbitrary rules, enabling communities to evolve like natural systems.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Thread Dynamics

- Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors.
- Threads act as resonant cavities for value.
- Teams naturally form around valuable threads.
- Natural cooling over time creates stability.

### 2. Token Flow

- **Unanimous Approval**: Stake distributes equally to approvers as direct rewards.
- **Denials**: Stake flows to the thread, strengthening the collective.
- **Split Decisions**:
  - Approvers' share flows to Treasury.
  - Deniers' share strengthens the thread.
- **Prior Rewards**: Treasury funds thread citations, coupling knowledge networks.

### 3. Team Formation

- Threads accumulate collective value.
- Co-authors share in thread success.
- Quality benefits the whole team.
- Natural incentive alignment promotes collaboration.

### 4. Knowledge Networks

- Threads cite valuable threads.
- Prior rewards strengthen thread coupling.
- Knowledge topology emerges.
- System-wide coherence develops.

## Natural Evolution

### 1. Temperature Dynamics

- **Hot Threads** (High Activity):
  - Higher stake requirements.
  - More volatile state.
  - Quality filter through cost.
  - Natural selection pressure.
- **Cool Threads** (Stable):
  - Lower barriers to entry.
  - More stable state.
  - Experimental space.
  - Nurtures new voices.

### 2. Frequency Effects

- Higher frequency indicates better organization.
- Co-authors strengthen coherence.
- Natural resonance emerges.
- Communities crystallize naturally.

### 3. Energy Conservation

- Total token supply fixed at 10 billion.
- Circular flow through Treasury.
- Split decisions feed prior rewards.
- System maintains equilibrium.

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Message Submission

- Users stake CHOIR tokens.
- Stake requirement based on thread state.
- Energy locked until a decision is made.
- Natural barrier against noise and spam.

### 2. Approval Process

- Co-authors evaluate within 7 days.
- Unanimous approval required.
- Split decisions balance incentives.
- Denials strengthen threads through increased energy.

### 3. Value Distribution

- Approvers receive direct rewards.
- Threads accumulate collective value.
- Treasury enables knowledge coupling.
- Teams share in collective success.

## Technical Foundation

### 1. Quantum Harmonic Model

- Threads modeled as resonant cavities.
- Energy conservation principles apply.
- Phase transition dynamics are utilized.
- Natural frequency evolution guides growth.

### 2. Implementation

- Solana blockchain for token accounting.
- Real-time state transitions.
- AI-enhanced pattern recognition.
- Natural system monitoring and adjustments.

## Future Vision

The platform will evolve like a natural system:

- Teams will form around resonant threads.
- Quality standards will emerge organically.
- Knowledge networks will self-organize.
- Evolution will be sustainable and adaptive.

## Join Us

Experience a platform where quality emerges naturally, teams form organically, and value aligns with coherence. Be part of a system that works with nature rather than against it.
