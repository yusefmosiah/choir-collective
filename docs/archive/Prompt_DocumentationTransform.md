# Documentation Transform Pattern

VERSION transform_pattern:
invariants: {
"Network coherence",
"Service coordination",
"Distributed patterns"
}
assumptions: {
"Service architecture",
"Network dynamics",
"Collective evolution"
}
docs_version: "0.3.0"

## Core Transform Pattern

A pattern for transforming documentation to reflect distributed system architecture:

1. Collect Phase
- Map service boundaries
- Identify network flows
- Document interactions
- Note distributed patterns
- Recognize system topology

2. Summarize Phase
- Extract service interfaces
- Identify network protocols
- Map data flows
- Note consensus requirements
- Capture system dynamics

3. Transform Phase
- Map service architectures
- Define network protocols
- Maintain coherence
- Enable evolution
- Preserve value

4. Refactor Phase
- Unify service interfaces
- Optimize network flows
- Clarify boundaries
- Strengthen patterns
- Improve coordination

## Context Injection

The transform requires clear context for distributed services:

Service Context
- Core capabilities
- Network protocols
- Value propositions
- System flows

Network Context
- Service topology
- Data distribution
- Consensus mechanisms
- Natural evolution

Integration Context
- Service coordination
- Value preservation
- Network evolution
- Pattern emergence

## Example: Web to Native Transform

Our concrete example of the transform pattern:

Old Context (Web/React)
- Monolithic architecture
- Browser-based wallet
- REST/GraphQL APIs
- Traditional state
- Centralized docs

New Context (Native/Swift)
- Distributed services
- Network coordination
- Event-driven protocols
- Consensus-based state
- System-wide docs

Transform Applied
```
// Core services
Core_Effects.md -> core_chorus.md         # AI service
Core_Priors.md -> core_knowledge.md       # Vector service
Core_Architecture.md -> core_architecture.md  # System topology

// Implementation services
Plan_Frontend.md -> goal_implementation.md    # Client service
Plan_Architecture.md -> goal_architecture.md  # Network architecture
Plan_Evolution.md -> goal_evolution.md        # System evolution

// Theory foundations
Theory_Quantum.md -> theory_foundation.md     # Network dynamics
Theory_Economics.md -> theory_economics.md    # Value distribution
Theory_Dynamics.md -> theory_dynamics.md      # System behavior
```

Key Transformations
- Monolith → Distributed services
- REST → Event streams
- Browser wallet → Network consensus
- Server state → Distributed state
- Traditional docs → Service docs

Pattern Preservation
- Service coordination
- Value consensus
- Network evolution
- System coherence

## Implementation Notes

The transform should:
1. Preserve service boundaries
2. Enable network coordination
3. Strengthen patterns
4. Maintain coherence
5. Improve clarity

Success Metrics
- Clear service separation
- Network efficiency
- Pattern strength
- System flow
- Evolution capability

This pattern enables:
1. Service architecture transforms
2. Network protocol mapping
3. Value preservation
4. Pattern emergence
5. System evolution

The system ensures:
- Service coordination
- Network coherence
- Value preservation
- Natural flow
- System evolution
