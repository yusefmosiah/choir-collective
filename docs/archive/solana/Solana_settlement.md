## Core Settlement Types

TYPE Settlement = {
resonance: ResonantState,
energy: TokenAmount,
oscillators: Set<PublicKey>,
outcome: HarmonicOutcome,
pattern: ResonantPattern
}

TYPE HarmonicOutcome =
| Resonant: energy -> approver_oscillators // Unanimous approval: stake distributes to approvers
| Dispersed: energy -> thread_resonance // Denial: stake flows to thread
| Mixed: { // Split decision:
approvers: energy -> treasury_field, // approvers' share to treasury
deniers: energy -> thread_resonance // deniers' share to thread
}
| Decayed: energy -> treasury_field // Expired
| Decoupled: thread_resonance/n -> co_author // Divest

TYPE ResonantPattern = {
timestamp: i64,
transaction_id: Hash,

## Error Handling

TYPE SettlementError =
| InsufficientEnergy
| InvalidResonance
| UnauthorizedPhase
| SettlementDissonance
| ResonanceMismatch

revert_energy_flow()
unlock_resonators()
emit_error_pattern(error)
RETURN Err(error)

## Implementation Notes

The settlement system maintains several critical properties:

1. Energy Safety

   - All transfers preserve phase
   - Energy always conserved
   - Resonators properly coupled
   - Phase alignment verified

2. Settlement Coherence

   - Outcomes are resonant
   - Distributions maintain harmony
   - State remains coherent
   - Patterns are recorded

3. Error Recovery
   - Failed settlements revert
   - Resonators decouple cleanly
   - State preserves coherence
   - Patterns remain intact

Through these mechanisms, the settlement system provides secure and reliable energy distribution while maintaining strong resonant properties.
