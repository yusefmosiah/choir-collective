Choir is a chat platform where you actually own your messages and can earn tokens for quality contributions. Let's break down how it works in simple terms:

## Basic Functionality

When you start using Choir, you'll find it familiar yet unique. You can join existing chat threads or start new ones. The key difference is that messages require approval from everyone participating in the thread - we call these participants "co-authors."

Think of a thread like a shared document where everyone who's contributed good content has a say in what gets added next. When you write a message that gets approved, you become a co-author of that thread. This means you'll help decide on future additions too.

## Token System

Choir uses tokens in a straightforward way:

1. **Making Contributions**

   - When you want to contribute to a thread where you're not yet a co-author, you'll need to stake some tokens
   - Think of this like putting down a deposit that shows you're serious about making a valuable contribution

2. **Approval Outcomes**

   - If all co-authors approve your message:
     - You become a co-author
     - The stake is distributed equally among the approvers as a reward
   - If any co-author denies your message:
     - The stake goes to strengthen the thread
   - If there's a mix of approvals and denials:
     - Approvers' share goes to the treasury
     - Deniers' share goes to the thread

3. **Thread Value**
   - Threads accumulate tokens over time
   - When threads are referenced in other threads, they earn rewards
   - This creates natural incentives for quality content
   - Teams naturally form around valuable threads

## Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse existing threads
3. Start contributing to discussions
4. Earn co-authorship through quality content
5. Help curate future contributions

## Practical Benefits

- You own your contributions
- Quality content is rewarded
- Spam and noise are minimized
- Collaborative discussions evolve naturally
- Value accumulates in successful threads
- Teams form around shared success

## Simple Guidelines

- Write thoughtful messages
- Consider the thread's context
- Respect co-author decisions
- Contribute meaningfully
- Build relationships through collaboration

The beauty of Choir is that while these mechanics are simple to understand, they create space for sophisticated collaboration and value creation. You don't need to understand all the deeper implications to start participating and benefiting from the platform.
