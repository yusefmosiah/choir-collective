# Deploy Checklist for Render

This checklist tracks the deployment status of the Next.js application on Render. After successful frontend deployment, we can proceed with integrating the Python backend.

## Prerequisites

- [x] **Render Account**: Ensure you have a Render account and are logged in.
- [x] **Git Repository**: Your code should be in a Git repository.

## Current Repository Structure

- [x] **Verify Structure**:
  ```
  .
  ├── src/               # Next.js application source
  ├── public/           # Static files
  ├── Dockerfile        # Docker configuration
  ├── package.json      # Node.js dependencies
  └── pnpm-lock.yaml    # Lock file
  ```

## Next.js Deployment

- [x] **Create Web Service**:
  - [x] Click **New** and select **Web Service**
  - [x] Connect your repository
  - [x] Set root directory to `/` (project root)
  - [x] Set build command: `pnpm install && pnpm run build`
  - [x] Set start command: `pnpm start`

- [x] **Configure Service**:
  - [x] **Name**: Set to `choir-collective`
  - [x] **Region**: Selected deployment region
  - [x] **Instance Type**: Chosen appropriate instance type
  - [x] **Branch**: Selected deployment branch (e.g., `main`)

- [x] **Set Environment Variables**:
  - [x] `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
  - [x] `PORT`: Set to `80` for production
  - [x] Other required environment variables

## Security & HTTPS

- [x] **Verify HTTPS**:
  - [x] Render automatically provisioned TLS certificate
  - [x] HTTP traffic automatically redirects to HTTPS
  - [x] No manual SSL/TLS configuration required

## Deployment Verification

- [x] **Test Application**: Verified at https://choir-collective.onrender.com/
  - [x] Application loads correctly over HTTPS
  - [x] All pages are accessible
  - [x] Solana integration works
  - [x] UI components render properly
  - [x] SSL certificate is valid

- [x] **Monitor Logs**: Use Render's logging tools to:
  - Check for any startup issues
  - Verify application is running correctly
  - Monitor for any errors

## Continuous Deployment

- [x] **Auto-Deploy Settings**:
  - Enable auto-deploy for the main branch
  - Configure branch deploy settings if needed
  - Test auto-deploy by pushing a small change

## Performance Monitoring

- [ ] **Configure Monitoring**:
  - [ ] Set up logging
  - [ ] Monitor service metrics
  - [ ] Set up alerts for any issues

## Next Steps: Backend Integration

- [ ] **Document Integration Points**: Identify where the Python backend will integrate
- [ ] **Plan API Structure**: Document the API endpoints needed for backend integration
- [ ] **Update Environment Variables**: List additional variables needed for backend integration

This checklist shows good progress with the Next.js deployment. The focus can now shift to setting up monitoring, continuous deployment, and preparing for backend integration.
